Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk and operational risk.\nEvaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality Risk\nThe Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Company manages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. In connection with its investment and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or credit ratings/spreads. The Company\u2019s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to varying degrees of interest rate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for hedging, the Company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk.\nInvestments\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio supported the following products at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nInvestment risks associated with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company\u2019s operating results. The risks associated with investments supporting experience-rated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company\u2019s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by the contract holders and not by the Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may be subject to contract holder or participant withdrawals.\nThe debt securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 with approximately $4.4 billion and $3.9 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The debt securities that were rated below investment grade (that is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively (of which 4% and 6% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, supported experience-rated products).\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held $333 million and $373 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third parties, representing 2% of total investments at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA and AA- at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the guarantee. These securities had an average credit quality rating of A+ and A- at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, without the guarantee. The Company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or indirect).\nThe Company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31, 2019 and 2018, less than 1% of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company\u2019s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America).

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. We address interest rate risks primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. We do not currently hedge foreign exchange risk, as discussed further below. The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided regarding our foreign currency exchange rates and financial instruments to which we are a party at December 31, 2020, and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and/or foreign currency rates. We do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nInterest Rates\nWe have interest rate risk on our variable-rate debt obligations, primarily consisting of our U.S. Floorplan Line. Based on the amount of variable-rate borrowings outstanding of $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $16.0 million and $18.3 million change to our annual interest expense, respectively, after consideration of the average interest rate swaps in effect during the periods.\nThe majority of our floorplan notes payable, mortgages and other debt are benchmarked to LIBOR. The Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents the best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR. A similar transition away from LIBOR is occurring in the U.K. to the Sterling Overnight Indexed Average. The use of an alternative rate could result in increased interest expense, in addition to costs to amend the loan agreements and other applicable arrangements to a new reference rate.\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to our variable-rate floorplan borrowings is partially mitigated by manufacturers\u2019 interest assistance, which in some cases is influenced by changes in market-based variable interest rates. We reflect interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle inventory cost until the associated vehicle is sold. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $47.3 million and $49.1 million of interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales, respectively.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nThe functional currency of our U.K. subsidiaries is the GBP and of our Brazil subsidiaries is the BRL. Our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating financial statements of those subsidiaries into our reporting currency, which we do not hedge against based on our investment strategy in these foreign operations. A 10% devaluation in average exchange rates for the GBP to the USD would have resulted in a $195.3 million and $219.4 million decrease to our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 10% devaluation in average exchange rates for the BRL to the USD would have resulted in a $22.9 million and $40.5 million decrease to our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor additional information about our market sensitive financial instruments, see Note 6. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements within our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A. provides quantitative and qualitative information about the market risks faced by the company, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio and interest rates.\nValuation Risk\nOur investments may not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2019, on a fair value basis, two of our debt investments bear interest at a fixed rate. All of our other debt investments bear interest at a floating rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors. Interest rates on the investments held within our portfolio of investments are typically based on floating LIBOR, with many of these investments also having a LIBOR floor. Additionally, our Credit Facilities are also subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating LIBOR rates.\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our income in the future.\nThe following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income, should interest rates increase or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our settled portfolio of debt investments held as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the settled debt investments in our portfolio held as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates and the impact of that change on interest income. Interest expense is calculated based on outstanding secured borrowings as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and based on the terms of our Credit Facilities. Interest expense on our Credit Facilities is calculated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. We intend to continue to finance a portion of our investments with borrowings and the interest rates paid on our borrowings may impact significantly our net interest income.\nWe regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates.\nBased on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates for our settled debt investments (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) and outstanding secured borrowings assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:\nItem 8.", "summary": "A is a disclosure about the market risks that the company is subject to, such as changes in the valuations of its investment portfolio and interest rates.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\n(dollars in thousands)\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations. Interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate-sensitive assets, liabilities and commitments. Lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers, while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans. We have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes.\nOur homebuilding segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its debt obligations. In September 2012, we issued $600,000 of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes mature on September 15, 2022 and bear interest at 3.95%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15. Changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt instruments, but not earnings or cash flows. We generally have no obligation to prepay the Senior Notes prior to maturity, and therefore, interest rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on our fixed-rate debt.\nIn July 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement which provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of $200,000. Under the Credit Agreement, we may request increases of up to $300,000 to the Facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments. The Credit Agreement provides for a $100,000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately $9,700 outstanding at December 31, 2019, and a $25,000 sublimit for a swing line commitment. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest for Base Rate Loans at a Base Rate equal to the highest of (i) a Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent, (ii) Bank of America\u2019s publicly announced \u201cprime rate,\u201d and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus one percent, plus the Applicable Rate which is based on our debt rating, or for Eurodollar Rate Loans, at the Eurodollar Rate equal to LIBOR plus the Applicable Rate. At December 31, 2019, there was no debt outstanding under the Facility.\nOur mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities. The mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans, which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets. All of the mortgage banking segment\u2019s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments. NVRM also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis.\nNVRM has available a mortgage Repurchase Agreement, which as of December 31, 2019 provided for loan repurchases up to $150,000. The Repurchase Agreement is used to fund NVRM\u2019s mortgage origination activities. Advances under the Repurchase Agreement carry a Pricing Rate based on the LIBOR Rate plus the LIBOR Margin, as determined under the Repurchase Agreement, provided that the Pricing Rate shall not be less than 1.85%. At December 31, 2019, there was no debt outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement.\nThe following table represents the contractual balances of our on-balance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates, as well as the fair values of those on-balance sheet financial instruments at December 31, 2019. The expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS\nCommodity Risk\nThe Company\u2019s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production. Historically, prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue. Monthly oil price realizations during 2019 ranged from a low of $46.39 per barrel to a high of $58.60 per barrel. During the first quarter of 2020, the industry has seen a severe decline in oil commodity pricing from year-end 2019 pricing due to economic conditions worldwide caused by the novel virus outbreak, combined with an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia which is further depressing crude oil pricing. The Company can operate in the short-term at these depressed levels, but would need to access additional capital should prices continue at these depressed level for an extended period of time.\nIn addition, during 2010, 2011, and 2012 the Company participated in derivative agreements on a specified number of barrels of oil of its production. The Company did not participate in any derivative agreements during 2019 or 2018 but may participate in derivative activities in the future.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had finance leases outstanding of approximately $102,000, and no amounts owed on its credit facility with Prosperity Bank. As of December 31, 2019, the interest rate on the credit facility was variable at a rate equal to prime plus 0.50% per annum. The Company\u2019s credit facility interest rate at December 31, 2019 was 5.25%. The Company\u2019s finance leases of $102,000 has fixed interest rates ranging from approximately 5.0% to 6.5%.\nThe annual impact on interest expense and the Company\u2019s cash flows of a 10% increase in the interest rate on the credit facility would be approximately zero assuming borrowed amounts under the credit facility remained at the same amount owed as of December 31. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nForward-Looking Statements and Risk\nCertain statements in this Report including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company are forward-looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Company\u2019s control, and which would cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions, and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology, and other factors can also affect these risks.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our portfolio of short- and long-term cash investments, our note receivable from NBC, our convertible note payable to NBC, and equity security prices.\nInterest rate sensitivity\nWe invest primarily in instruments issued by high quality financial institutions and companies including demand and money market instruments and debt issued by corporations. All of our investments have maturities of less than two years. Investments in fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry interest rate risk in that the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted if interest rates rise while floating rate securities may produce less interest income if interest rates fall. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $2.1 million decrease in the fair value of the Company's debt securities classified as available-for-sale.\nBecause the interest rates on the note receivable from NBC and convertible note payable to NBC are fixed, an increase in interest rates causes the fair value of the note receivable to decline and the fair value of the convertible note payable to rise and a decrease in interest rates has the opposite effect.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nOur foreign operations are primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Germany. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to our net equity position reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not currently hedge our equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. We recorded cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation losses in stockholders\u2019 equity of $23.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and $36.3 million as of December 31, 2018. We recorded unrealized foreign currency translation gains in other comprehensive income of $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and foreign currency translation losses of $24.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, in each case, net of tax.\nFor purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period. As a result, our consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as revenue and segment operating income of our foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period to period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed. Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons. We do not currently hedge our net earnings exposure arising from the translation of our foreign revenue and segment operating income. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Foreign Exchange Rate Variances\u201d (Part II, Item 7 of this 2019 Form 10-K) for a further discussion.\nA hypothetical change of 10% in the Canadian dollar exchange rate would result in a change to 2019 operating income of approximately $5.3 million. A hypothetical change of 10% in the British pound exchange rate would result in a change to 2019 operating income of approximately $0.1 million. A hypothetical change of 10% in the Euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2019 operating income of approximately $0.4 million.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk, as our foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.\nWe are exposed to short-term and long-term interest rate risk on certain of our debt obligations.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any outstanding \u201cmarket risk sensitive instruments,\u201d as such term is used within the meaning of Item 305 of SEC Regulation S-K. However, the Company is subject to other types of business risk described below and under \u201cMarket Risks Related to Real Estate Loans\u201d in Item 1A. Risk Factors above.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWhile all the Company\u2019s loans bear a fixed rate and the Company does not have any interest-rate sensitive instruments obligations outstanding, the nature of the Company\u2019s business exposes it to business risk arising from changes in interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the Company. An increase or decrease in interest rates would not impact the interest charged on the Company\u2019s then existing loan portfolio, as the Company\u2019s loans bear fixed rates of interest. However, a rapid significant increase in interest rates may reduce the demand for mortgage loans due to the higher cost of borrowing, potentially resulting in a reduced demand for real estate, declining real estate values and higher default rates. Alternatively, a significant rapid decline in interest rates may negatively affect the amount of interest that the Company may charge on new loans, including those that are made with capital received as outstanding loans mature. Additionally, declining interest rates may also result in prepayments of existing loans, which may also result in the redeployment of capital in new loans bearing lower interest rates.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company\u2019s loans are subject to credit risk. Credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults. Default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, borrower financial condition, property performance, property management, supply and demand factors, construction trends, consumer behavior, regional economics, interest rates, the strength of the U.S. economy and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. All loans are subject to a certain possibility of default. The Company seeks to mitigate credit risk by originating loans which are secured by first position liens on real estate with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 65%. The Company also undertakes extensive due diligence of the property that will be mortgaged to secure the loans, including review of third-party appraisals on the property.\nRisks Related to Real Estate\nResidential and commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, events such as natural disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes, acts of war and terrorism, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors)\u037e local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing, retail, industrial, office or other commercial space)\u037e changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments\u037e construction quality, construction cost, age and design\u037e demographic factors\u037e retroactive changes to building or similar codes\u037e and increases in operating expenses (such as energy costs). In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the loans, which could also cause Company to suffer losses. These factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to its members.\nBroadmark Realty Capital Inc.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK is a disclosure by Broadmark Realty Capital Inc. about the market risks associated with their business.

We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $973 billion in assets under management and administration as of December 31, 2019. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients\u2019 financial objectives. For additional discussion of our businesses, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships.\nFinancial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - \u201cRisk Factors\u201d - and other factors as discussed herein.\nEquity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the \u201cspread\u201d income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d) and deferred sales inducement costs (\u201cDSIC\u201d) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.\nEarnings, as well as adjusted operating earnings, will be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment should it continue. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our adjusted operating earnings.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOn October 29, 2018, the Company entered into the TOKIN Term Loan Facility and received funding on November 7, 2018 at an equivalent of $292.0 million using the exchange rate on November 7, 2018. The TOKIN Term Loan Facility has a variable interest rate and had an outstanding principal balance of $285.5 million as of March 31, 2019. We are exposed to interest rate risk through the Term Loan Facility, and a 1% change in the interest rate would yield a $2.9 million change in interest expense on an annualized basis.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nGiven our international operations and sales, we are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates. Of these, the most significant are currently the Euro, Japanese Yen, Thai Baht, Taiwan New Dollar, and Mexican Peso. A portion of our sales to our customers and operating costs in Europe, Japan, and Thailand are denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen, and Thai Baht, respectively, creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. Also, a portion of our costs in our operations in Mexico are denominated in Mexican Pesos, creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries make sales denominated in U.S. dollars which expose them to foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Historically, to minimize our exposure, we periodically entered into forward foreign exchange contracts in which the future cash flows were hedged against the U.S. dollar (see Note 12, \u201cDerivatives\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nAdditionally, during fiscal year 2019, the we entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency risk on Intercompany Loans and to hedge the JPY currency exposure of the Company's net investment in TOKIN. We use these derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure.\nA 10 percent weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies we transact in would result in approximately a $14.2 million increase or a $11.9 million decrease to our net income, respectively.\nRaw Material Price Risk\nAs a result of our tantalum vertical integration efforts which began in fiscal year 2012, we have reduced our exposure to price volatility and supply uncertainty in the tantalum supply chain. A majority of our tantalum needs are now met through our direct sourcing of conflict free tantalum ore or tantalum scrap reclaim, which is then processed into the intermediate product potassium heptafluorotantalate (commonly known as K-salt) at our facility in Mexico, before final processing into tantalum powder at KBP. Price increases for tantalum ore, or for the remaining tantalum powder that we source from third parties, could impact our financial performance as we may be unable to pass all such price increases on to our customers.\nSilver and aluminum have generally been available in sufficient quantities, and we believe there are enough suppliers from which we can purchase our requirements. An increase in the price of silver and aluminum that we are unable to pass on to our customers, however, could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nTo evaluate the impact of price changes in precious metals on net income we used the following assumptions: the selling prices of our products would not be impacted, all the precious metals change in the same direction at the same time, and we do not have commitment contracts in place. Under these assumptions, a 10 percent increase or decrease in the cost of precious metals would result in approximately a $11.0 million increase or decrease to our net income. We believe we have partially mitigated this risk through our vertical integration efforts.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and raw material price fluctuations.

In January 2021, we acquired the majority of the logistics operations of Kuehne + Nagel in the U.K. and Ireland, which increased our location count to 1,629 and our number of employees to approximately 108,000. We use our highly integrated network to help more than 50,000 customers operate their supply chains most efficiently.\nWe have two reporting segments, Transportation and Logistics, each with robust service offerings, leadership positions and growth prospects. In 2020, approximately 62% of our revenue came from Transportation, and the remaining 38% came from Logistics. Within each segment, we are positioned to capitalize on fast-growing areas of demand.\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it affects our employees, customers and business partners.

The spin-off, which we intend to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes to XPO shareholders, would result in XPO shareholders owning stock in both companies. If completed, the spin-off will result in separate public companies with clearly delineated service offerings. XPO will be a global provider of primarily less-than-truckload (\u201cLTL\u201d) transportation and truck brokerage services, and the spun-off company will be the second largest contract logistics provider in the world. Both companies\u2019 stocks are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, and we plan to consider a dual listing on the London Stock Exchange for the spun-off company in due course.\nThe transaction is currently expected to be completed in the second half of 2021, subject to various conditions.

In the normal course of business, the Company may have other pending claims and legal proceedings. It is our opinion, based on information available at this time, that any other current claim or proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn February 1, 2016, TRC was sued in Person County, North Carolina, by a subcontractor, PPS Engineers, Inc. (\u201cPPS\u201d), in an attempt to force TRC to pay invoices for services rendered in the total amount of $2.3 million. In addition, PPS placed liens on the property of customers in several states where work was performed by PPS and it also filed a claim in Tennessee against the bond issued on behalf of TRC relating to one significant project located there. On March 4, 2016, TRC filed responses to the claims of PPS, asserting that PPS failed to deliver a number of items required by the applicable contract between the parties, that the invoices rendered by PPS covering the disputed services would not be paid until such deliverables were supplied, and\nthat certain sums were owed to it by PPS for services, furniture, fixtures, equipment, and software that were supplied by TRC on behalf of PPS. The amounts invoiced by PPS were accrued by TRC and the corresponding liability amounts were included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet as January 31, 2018. TRC did not record an account receivable for the amounts it believes are owed to it by PPS. A mediation effort was attempted in 2016 but it was unproductive in resolving the disputes.\nIn December 2017, an amended complaint was filed by the plaintiff and TRC filed an amended counterclaim and the discovery process began. In July 2018, the parties agreed to a settlement of all claims made against each other with TRC agreeing to make a payment to PPS in the amount of $0.9 million. As the total of the previously accrued amounts exceeded the negotiated settlement amount, the Company recorded a gain on the settlement in the amount of $1.4 million that is included in other income for Fiscal 2019.\nGPS was in a dispute with a former subcontractor on one of its power plant construction projects that was settled pursuant to binding arbitration in June 2018. The arbitration panel awarded approximately $5.2 million, plus interest and arbitration fees, to the subcontractor. The substantial portion of the total amount, which was paid by GPS to the subcontractor in July 2018, was charged to cost of revenues. In connection with the settlement, the legal claims made by the parties against each other were dismissed with prejudice and without costs to the parties, all liens filed by the subcontractor related to the project were released, and each party provided the other with a release from future claims related to this matter.\nIn January 2019, GPS sued Exelon West Medway II, LLC and Exelon Generation Company, LLC (collectively \u201cExelon\u201d) for Exelon\u2019s breach of contract and failure to remedy various events which negatively impacted the schedule and costs of the Exelon West Medway II Facility resulting in Exelon receiving the benefits of GPS\u2019s work without making payment for the value.

The Company believes it has met all requirements under U.K. VAT law for a cost sharing group VAT exemption to apply and is entitled to recover the \u00a318.6 million related to the assessments and subsequent payments that have been paid through December 31, 2019. Following a hearing held in January 2019 before the First Tier Tax Tribunal, all issues related to law in the case were referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union. In the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a full provision of \u00a317.3 million against a receivable to expense due to developments in the case. Of this amount, \u00a314.1 million relates to years 2014 to 2018. If the Company ultimately prevails in this case, the provision will be reversed, and a pre-tax credit will be recorded as a reduction to expense in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The result of the Court of Justice case is expected by the fall of 2020. Depending on the judgment of the Court of Justice, the litigation may conclude or some issues may be returned to the UK First Tier Tribunal.\nOn March 28, 2016, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by Erin Fries, a physical therapist formerly employed by Residential, against Residential Home Health, LLC, Residential Home Health Illinois, LLC, and David Curtis. The complaint alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Illinois minimum wage law. The matter was settled in September 2019, and the class-action settlement was approved by the court in November 2019.\nOn January 10, 2020, Kaplan Bournemouth Limited received an improvement notice from Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, a local government authority, under section 11 of the U.K. Housing Act 2004 in relation to its leased student residence in Bournemouth, U.K. This notice follows the Council\u2019s assessment that a category 1 fire hazard exists at the property and requires certain remedial work to be undertaken at the property within a specified timetable. This work comprises a number of items, including the removal of aluminum composite material (ACM) cladding and high pressure laminate (HPL) cladding from the facade of the building. Kaplan Bournemouth Limited appealed the notice on January 31, 2020, to contest certain remedial requirements, although it will not contest the requirement for the removal of the ACM and HPL cladding. If Kaplan is not successful in its appeal, additional substantial work may be required in connection with the building.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to complaints and administrative proceedings and are defendants in various other civil lawsuits that have arisen in the ordinary course of their businesses, including contract disputes; actions alleging negligence, libel, defamation, invasion of privacy; trademark, copyright and patent infringement; violations of employment laws and applicable wage and hour laws; and statutory or common law claims involving current and former students and employees. While it is not possible to predict the outcomes of these lawsuits, in the opinion of management, their ultimate dispositions should not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nItem 4.", "summary": "Legal Proceedings Summary:\nHer Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has raised assessments against Kaplan U.K. Pathways for Value Added Tax (VAT) relating to 2017 and earlier years, which Kaplan has paid.

Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in various claims, legal actions and regulatory proceedings incidental to and in the ordinary course of business, including administrative hearings of the APSC, MPUC, MDTC, MPSC, NHPUC, VPUC and WVPSC relating primarily to rate making and customer service requirements. In addition, we may be involved in similar proceedings with interconnection carriers and the FCC. Currently, none of our legal proceedings are expected to have a material effect on our business.\nOn September 1, 2020, a purported stockholder of Otelco filed a putative stockholder class action lawsuit, captioned Patrick Plumley v.

The Actions generally allege that the Preliminary Proxy Statement or the Definitive Proxy Statement omits certain material information in violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder,\nand further that the members of our Board of Directors are liable for those omissions under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The relief sought in the Actions includes a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent the completion of the Merger, rescission or rescissory damages if the Merger is completed, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Both lawsuits have subsequently been withdrawn.\nWhile we believe that the disclosures set forth in the Preliminary Proxy Statement and Definitive Proxy Statement complied fully with applicable law, to resolve the alleged stockholders\u2019 claims and moot the disclosure claims, to avoid nuisance, potential expense, and delay and to provide additional information to our stockholders, we voluntarily supplemented the Definitive Proxy Statement with additional disclosures filed with the SEC on October 1, 2020. Nothing in the supplemental disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosures set forth therein or in the Definitive Proxy Statement. To the contrary, we denied all allegations that any additional disclosure was, or is, required.\nItem 4.", "summary": "Mine Safety Disclosures\n\nOtelco is involved in various legal proceedings related to rate making and customer service requirements with the APSC, MPUC, MDTC, MPSC, NHPUC, VPUC and WVPSC, as well as similar proceedings with interconnection carriers and the FCC.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nThe functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the respective local currencies. Our sales are typically denominated in the local currency of the country in which the sale was made. The majority of our sales are made in the United States and those sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the portion of our revenue that is subject to significant foreign currency risk is lessened. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which are primarily in the United States, Europe, China, India, Japan, and Australia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments. For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $175.8 million as of January 31, 2019. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held for working capital purposes. We do not make investments for trading or\nspeculative purposes. Additionally, under our Debt Agreement, we pay interest on any outstanding balances based on a variable market rate. A significant change in these market rates may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur cash equivalents and short-term investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of our expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our short-term investments as \u201cavailable-for-sale,\u201d no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.\nAs of January 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10% relative change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents and short-term investments or interest owed on our outstanding debt. Fluctuations in the value of our cash equivalents and short-term investments caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities prior to maturity. In addition, a hypothetical 10% relative change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our operating results for fiscal 2019.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to in the ordinary course of its business. These risks include foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. The company does not enter into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments.

The increase in general expenses is primarily due to decrease in professional fees and registration related expenses during the year ended February 28, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal Years ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018\nAs of February 28, 2019, our total assets were $21,897 comprised of $17,662 cash and cash equivalents and $4,235 prepaid expenses and our total liabilities were $77,038 comprised of $300 accounts payable and $76,738 advances from related parties.\nAs of February 28, 2018, our total assets were $51,455 comprised of $39,720 cash and cash equivalents and $11,735 prepaid expenses and out total liabilities were $76,838 comprised of $100 accounts payable and $76,738 advances from related parties.\nStockholders\u2019 equity decreased from a deficit of $(25,383) as of February 28, 2018 to a deficit of $(55,141) as of February 28, 2019.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe Company has not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended February 28, 2019, net cash flows used in operating activities was $22,058. For the year ended February 28, 2018, net cash flows used in operating activities were $19,712.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe Company has financed our operations primarily from either advances from related parties or the issuance of equity instruments. For the year ended February 28, 2019, there were no financing activities. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, net cash from financing activities was $57,705 consisting of $57,705 of proceeds in advances from related parties.\nMaterial Commitments\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company does not have any material commitments.\nPurchase of Significant Equipment\nThe Company does not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nItem 7A.", "summary": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe Company is not exposed to any material market risk related to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThis text discusses the financial condition and results of operations of a company for the years ended February 28, 2019 and 2018.

As part of our hedging policy implemented in 1999, we identify our future Canadian currency requirements related to payroll costs, capital expenditures and operating lease commitments, and purchase forward exchange contracts to cover our currency needs at the beginning of an operational period, generally two quarters. We do not enter into forward exchange contracts or any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nPrior to the year ended June 30, 1999, we did not engage in hedging transactions and our gains and losses on foreign currency transactions were not significant.\nUnder our current hedging policy, we identify our forward contracts related to operating lease commitments and commitments for capital expenditures as hedges of firm, identifiable Canadian currency commitments. We recognize the gains and losses on these contracts when the related lease commitment is paid or the capital expenditure is made. We recognize gains and losses on other forward contracts in earnings in the current period. As of June 30, 2000, we had outstanding currency forward exchange contracts of $5.5 million which will be held to maturity and relate to future operating expenses.

Given the historical volatility of certain of our food product prices, including proteins, seafood, produce, dairy products, and cooking oil, these fluctuations can materially impact our food costs. While our purchasing commitments partially mitigate the risk of such fluctuations, there is no assurance that supply and demand factors such as disease or inclement weather will not cause the prices of the commodities used in our restaurant operations to fluctuate. Additionally, the cost of purchased materials may be influenced by tariffs and other trade regulations which are outside of our control. To the extent that we do not pass along cost increases to our customers, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Currently, we do not use financial instruments to hedge our commodity risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates due to the variable rate indebtedness under our credit facility. Borrowings pursuant to our credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on one-month\nLIBOR, plus an applicable margin.\nEffective February 28, 2019, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $350,000 to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our variable rate credit facility. The agreements convert the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 2.47% plus a spread from the effective date through the term of our existing credit facility.\nInflation\nThe primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food, labor costs, and energy costs. Many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and utilities, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Also, the cost of new store construction is subject to inflationary increases in the costs of labor and material.\nWe have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or based on the applicable federal, state or city minimum wage and increases in the minimum wage will increase our labor costs. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted legislation to increase the minimum wage and/or minimum tipped wage rates by varying amounts, with more planned increases in the future.\nIn general, we have been able to partially offset cost increases resulting from inflation by increasing menu or game prices, improving productivity, or other operating changes.

The Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk.\nThe Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the Company's unsecured lines of credit and construction loans. The Company primarily enters into fixed and variable rate debt obligations to support acquisitions, development, capital expenditures and working capital needs. The Company continuously evaluates its level of variable debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment. The Company did not have any derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2000, but did have such instruments in previous years. In 1997, the Company entered into two treasury rate lock agreements, the purpose of which was to obtain what the Company considered advantageous pricing for future anticipated debt issuance. In 1998, the Company closed out a treasury rate lock agreement in conjunction with a $53 million secured mortgage loan due in 2005 issued in June 1998. The Company closed out its remaining treasury rate lock agreement in 1998 at a loss of $4.9 million.

LIBOR rates charged on our Line change monthly and the spread on the Line is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings.

We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. Our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection.\nWe continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt, to repay maturing debt, or fund our commitments.

In addition, the Company continually assesses the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.6 million per year based on $35.1 million of floating rate mortgage debt and $220.0 million of floating rate line of credit balance outstanding at December 31, 2019. If the Company increases its line of credit balance in the future, additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows could occur.\nFurther, the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2019, and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Since firm commitments are not presented, the table has limited predictive value. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest rates.\nThe table below presents the principal cash flow payments associated with our outstanding debt by year, weighted average interest rates on debt outstanding at each year-end, and fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2019.\n(1)\nReflects amount of debt maturities during each of the years presented as of December 31, 2019.\n(2)\nReflects weighted average interest rates of debt outstanding at the end of each year presented.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates from time to time and market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our cash flows and earnings.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding $1,430.0 million of 2023 Unsecured Notes, $900.0 million of 2025 Unsecured Notes, $1,650.0 million of 2027 Unsecured Notes, a balance of $488.7 million on our Term Loan Facility due 2021, a balance of $1,269.3 million on our Term Loan Facility due 2024, $145.0 million on our Revolver and $182.2 million of capital lease obligations. As of June 30, 2019, we had $296.5 million available for borrowing under our Revolver, subject to certain conditions.\nBased on current market interest rates for debt of similar terms and average maturities and based on recent transactions, we estimate the fair value of our Notes to be $4,067.7 million as of June 30, 2019. Our 2023 Unsecured Notes, 2025 Unsecured Notes, and 2027 Unsecured Notes accrue interest at fixed rates of 6.00%, 6.375%, and 5.75% respectively.\nBoth our Revolver and our Term Loan Facility accrue interest at floating rates subject to certain conditions. Our Term Loan Facility accrues interest at variable rates based upon the one month, three month or nine month LIBOR plus i) a spread of 2.0% on our $500.0 million tranche (which has a LIBOR floor of 0.0%) and ii) a spread of 2.25% on our B-2 Term Loan tranche (which has a LIBOR floor of 1.00%). Our Revolver accrues interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75% depending on our leverage ratio. As of June 30, 2019, the weighted average\ninterest rates (including margin) on the Term Loan Facility and our Revolver were approximately 4.6% and 4.2%, respectively. A hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rate on our Term Loan Facility and Revolver of one percentage point would increase our annualized interest expense on the Term Loan Facility and Revolver by approximately 21% or $19.0 million, based on the applicable interest rate as of June 30, 2019. Historically, this impact was limited as a result of the applicable interest rate being below the minimum 1.0% LIBOR floor on our Term Loan Facility tranche that matures on January 19, 2024.\nWe are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates if it is necessary to seek additional funding to support the expansion of our business and to support acquisitions. The interest rate that we may be able to obtain on future debt financings will be dependent on market conditions.\nWe have exposure to market risk arising from foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended June 30, 2019, our foreign activities accounted for approximately 21% of our consolidated revenue. We monitor foreign markets and our commitments in such markets to assess currency and other risks. A one percent change in foreign exchange rates would change consolidated revenue by approximately $5.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangement designed to limit exposure to foreign currencies. To the extent our level of foreign activities is expected to increase, through further acquisition and/or organic growth, we may determine that such hedging arrangements would be appropriate and will consider such arrangements to minimize our exposure to foreign exchange risk.\nWe do not have any material commodity price risk.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk exposure of a company, which includes changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. As we have operations in the United States and internationally, our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in inflation or interest rates. We do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a loss of $0.9 million, a loss of $2.0 million and a gain of $0.7 million on foreign exchange transactions, respectively. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. For business conducted outside of the United States, we may have both revenue and costs incurred in the local currency of the subsidiary, creating a partial natural hedge. Changes to exchange rates therefore have not had a significant impact on the business to date. However, we will continue to reassess our foreign exchange exposure as we continue to grow our business globally. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur primary market risk exposure is changing LIBO-based interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. The interest rates applicable to revolving borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement are, at the borrower\u2019s option, either (i) a base rate, which is equal to the greater of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus \u00bd of 1% and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one month Interest Period (each term as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement) plus 1%, or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate equal to the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (each term as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement), plus in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate (i) for base rate loans ranges from 0.25% to 1.0% per annum and (i) for LIBO Rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.0% per annum, in each case, based on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement). The Adjusted LIBO Rate cannot be less than zero. Base rate borrowings may only be made in dollars. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes a fallback provision, which, subject to certain terms and conditions, provides for a replacement of the LIBO Rate with (x) one or more SOFR-based rates or (y) any other alternative benchmark rate giving consideration to any evolving or then existing conventions for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total outstanding debt of $52.2 million under our 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. Based on the amounts outstanding, a 100-basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates over a twelve-month period would result in a change to interest expense of $0.5 million.\nInflation Risk\nBased on our analysis of the periods presented, we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operating results.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. We have not entered into any market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates. The range of changes presented reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period.\nAs of February 2, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 million. A change in market interest rates earned on our investments impacts the interest income and cash flows but does not materially impact the fair market value of the financial instruments. Due to the low balance, average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio. The impact on our future interest income resulting from changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio at that time. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income.\nThe components of our debt portfolio as of February 2, 2019 are $24.1 million due under our Term Loan, $2.9 million due under our equipment note, $1.4 million due under a sale and leaseback transaction and the $50.0 million Credit Facility. Each of the components of our debt portfolio are denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of the debt portfolio is referred to as the \u201cdebt value.\u201d The equipment note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.38%. Although a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest incurred or cash flow related to this fixed rate portion of the debt portfolio, the debt value would be affected.\nThe Term Loan carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices with a minimum annual rate of 9.0%. The sensitivity analysis as it relates to this portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point move in interest rates above and below the minimum threshold, with all other variables held constant. The debt value of the Term Loan is approximately $22.5 million. A 100-basis point increase in market interest rates above the minimum threshold would result in additional annual interest expense on the Term Loan of approximately $0.2 million. A 100-basis point decline in market interest rates below the minimum threshold would have no effect on our annual interest expense on the Term Loan.\nOur Credit Facility has variable interest rates that are tied to market indices. As of February 2, 2019, we had $20.4 million of direct borrowings and $6.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility. As of February 2, 2019, borrowings under the Credit Facility would have resulted in interest at a rate between approximately 4.10% and 5.75% per annum. Interest on any future borrowings under the Credit Facility would, to the extent of outstanding borrowings, be affected by changes in market interest rates. A change in market interest rates on the variable rate portion of our debt portfolio would impact the interest expense incurred and cash flows.\nThe sensitivity analysis as it relates to the fixed rate portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point move in interest rates from their levels as of February 2, 2019, with all other variables held constant. A 100-basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the value of the debt by less than $0.1 million as of February 2, 2019. A 100-basis point decline in market interest rates would cause the debt value to increase by less than $0.1 million as of February 2, 2019.\nOther than as described above, we do not believe that the market risk exposure on other financial instruments is material.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk exposure of the Company due to changes in interest rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company's consolidated balance sheets include a certain amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk. Due to the Company's significant investment in fixed-maturity investments, interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the Company's consolidated financial position. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2000, substantially all of the investments of Chandler Barbados and NAICO were in fixed-maturity investments (rated A1 or A+ or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's, respectively), interest-bearing money market accounts and a collateralized repurchase agreement. The Company does not hold any investments classified as trading account assets or derivative financial instruments.\nThe table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on the Company's fixed-maturity investment portfolio. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly, with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counteract that change. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates reflect what could be deemed best and worst case scenarios. The fair values shown in the following table are based on contractual maturities. Significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. The fair value of such instruments could be affected and, therefore, actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table:\nThe table above illustrates, for example, that an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in market interest rates at December 31, 2000 would reduce the estimated fair value of the Company's fixed-maturity investments by approximately $7.8 million at that date.\nChandler USA is obligated for senior debentures that have a maturity date of July 16, 2014. The debentures have a fixed interest rate of 8.75% and are redeemable on or after July 16, 2009 without penalty or premium.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, 56% (based on fair value) of the investments in our portfolio (including investments underlying the TRS) had floating interest rates, and both the TRS and the Financing Arrangement entered into with the BNPP entities have a floating rate structure. These investments are usually based on a floating LIBOR and typically have interest rate reset provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a monthly or quarterly basis.\nPursuant to the terms of the TRS, we pay fees to BNP Paribas a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum on the utilized notional amount of the loans subject to the TRS in exchange for the right to receive the economic benefit of a pool of loans having a maximum notional market value amount of $60,000,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Financing Arrangement, we pay fees to the BNPP entities a floating rate based on the asset type, but generally one-month LIBOR plus 1.30% per annum on the amount borrowed. To the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we or any of our subsidiaries enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we or our subsidiaries have such debt outstanding, or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments.\nA rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments, especially to the extent that we predominantly hold variable-rate investments, and to declines in the value of any fixed- rate investments we hold. To the extent that a majority of our investments may be in variable-rate investments, an increase in interest rates could make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate for the income incentive fee payable to the Adviser and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income, and also to the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to our increasing pre-incentive fee net investment income.\nAssuming that the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates.\n(1) Includes the net effect of the change in interest rates on the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the TRS. As of December 31, 2019, 100% of the loans underlying the TRS paid variable interest rates.\nAlthough we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowing under future credit facilities or other borrowing. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.\nWe may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts to the limited extent permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws.

{"section": "Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary objective of Red Hat's investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, the Company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds. The following table presents the fair value balances of the Company's cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of February 29, 2000:\nYear Ended (in thousands)\nFebruary February February -------- -------- -------- 28, 2001 28, 2002 28, 2003 Total -------- -------- -------- ----- Cash equivalents............... 242,426 242,426 Average interest rate.......... 6.0% Investments.................... 27,460 69,219 3,135 99,814 Average interest rates......... 6.1% 6.7% 7.26%\nRed Hat did not hold derivative financial instruments as of February 29, 2000, and has never held such investments in the past.\nForeign Currency Risk\nApproximately 25% of the Company's fiscal 2000 revenues were generated by sales outside the United States. The Company is exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses, which are recorded as a component in determining net income. Additionally, the assets and liabilities of the Company's non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates, and revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month the transactions occur. Unrealized translation gains and losses will be included as an adjustment to stockholders' equity.\nBased upon the foregoing, the Company began hedging its foreign currency receivables in the third quarter of 1999 in an effort to reduce its exposure to currency exchange rates. However, as a matter of procedure, the Company will not invest in speculative financial instruments as a means of hedging against such risk. The Company has no outstanding foreign currency hedging contracts at February 29, 2000. The Company's accounting policies for these contracts are based on the Company's designation of the contracts as hedging transactions. The criteria the Company uses for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract's effectiveness in risk reduction and one-to-one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions. If an underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated, the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period. In addition, since the Company enters into forward contracts only as a hedge, any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss, as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract. Information regarding the Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts is set forth in Note 13 of Item 14(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nRed Hat is exposed to market risk from interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.

Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., et al., was commenced in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey naming Hertz Holdings and certain of its officers as defendants and alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleged that Hertz Holdings made material misrepresentations and/or omission of material fact in its public disclosures during the period from February 25, 2013 through November 4, 2013, in violation of Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the purported class and an award of costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees. In June 2014, Hertz Holdings moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In October 2014, the court granted Hertz Holdings\u2019 motion to dismiss without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to amend the complaint a second time. In November 2014, plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, which shortened the putative class period and made allegations that were not substantively very different than the allegations in the prior complaint. In early 2015, Hertz Holdings moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. In July 2015, the court granted Hertz Holdings\u2019 motion to dismiss without prejudice, allowing plaintiff to file a third amended complaint. In August 2015, plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, which included additional allegations, named additional then-current and former officers as defendants and expanded the putative class period to extend from February 14, 2013 to July 16, 2015. In November 2015, Hertz Holdings moved to dismiss the third amended complaint. The plaintiff then sought leave to add a new plaintiff because of challenges to the standing of the first plaintiff. The court granted plaintiff leave to file a fourth amended complaint to add the new plaintiff, and the new complaint was filed on March 1, 2016. Hertz Holdings and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the fourth amended complaint with prejudice on March 24, 2016. In April 2017, the court granted Hertz Holdings' and the individual defendants' motions to dismiss and dismissed the action with prejudice. In May 2017, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and, in September 2018, the court affirmed the dismissal of the action with prejudice. On February 5, 2019, plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the judgment against it, and for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint would add allegations related to the settlement with the SEC that, among other things, ordered New Hertz to cease and desist from violating certain of the federal securities laws and imposed a civil penalty of\n$16.0 million. On February 26, 2019, New Hertz filed an opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief from judgment and leave to file a fifth amended complaint.

We have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical-based commodities. Approximately two-thirds of our raw materials are petroleum-based, the cost of which may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power, expanding our capabilities to substitute lower-cost raw materials, and reducing the amount of material required in each tire.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing. At December 31, 2019, 32% of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 3.81% compared to 33% at an average rate of 4.92% at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt, excluding finance leases, at December 31:\nThe pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency-denominated cash flows. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade purchases and sales, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation.\nThe following table presents foreign currency derivative information at December 31:\nThe pro forma decrease in fair value assumes a 10% adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK:\nThe following discussion about the Company's market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Company has market risk related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not generally use derivative financial instruments in connection with these market risks, except as noted below.\nInterest Rates - The Company's most significant long-term instrument is the domestic credit facility, which bears interest at variable rates based on LIBOR (Euro-LIBOR for balances drawn in Euros).\nThe following table presents information related to interest rate contracts entered into by the Company and designated as cash flow hedges:\nThe interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the future variable interest payments which are considered probable of occurring. Based on the Company's assessment, all the critical terms of each of the hedges matched the underlying terms of the hedged debt and related forecasted interest payments, and as such, these hedges were considered highly effective.\nThe fair value of the interest rate swaps reflected an unrealized loss, net of unrealized gains, of $534,000 ($403,000 after-tax) at September 30, 2019 that is included in equity as part of AOCI. A decrease of 10% in market interest rates (e.g., a decrease from 5.0% to 4.5%) would result in a decrease of approximately $1.0 million in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.\nCommodity Price Risks - In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price fluctuations related to the purchases of certain materials and supplies (such as bronze ingot, steel, granite, fuel and wood) used in its manufacturing operations. The Company obtains competitive prices for materials and supplies when available. In addition, based on competitive market conditions and to the extent that the Company has established pricing terms with customers through contracts or similar arrangements, the Company's ability to immediately increase the price of its products to offset the increased costs may be limited.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates - The Company is subject to changes in various foreign currency exchange rates, primarily including the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, and Australian Dollar in the conversion from local currencies to the U.S. dollar of the reported financial position and operating results of its non-U.S. based subsidiaries. An adverse change (strengthening U.S. dollar) of 10% in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in reported sales of $53.3 million and a decrease in reported operating income of $3.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2019.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, (continued)\nActuarial Assumptions - The most significant actuarial assumptions affecting pension expense and pension obligations include the valuation of retirement plan assets, the discount rates and the estimated return on plan assets. The estimated return on plan assets is currently based upon projections provided by the Company's independent investment advisor, considering the investment policy of the plan and the plan's asset allocation. The fair value of plan assets and discount rates are \"point-in-time\" measures, and volatility of the debt and equity markets makes estimating future changes in fair value of plan assets and discount rates challenging. The Company elected to value its principal retirement and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities using a modified assumption of future mortality that reflects a significant improvement in life expectancy over the previous mortality assumptions.

{"section": "ITEM 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThe Company uses certain financial derivatives to mitigate its exposure to volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses these derivative instruments to hedge exposures in the ordinary course of business and does not invest in derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The credit risk under these interest rate and foreign currency agreements is not considered to be significant. The Company attempts to manage market and credit risks associated with its derivative instruments by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken, and by entering into transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings. As of August 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s derivative counterparty had an investment grade credit rating.\nThe Company has manufacturing operations in the United States, Brazil, France, Italy, China, Turkey, and South Africa. The Company has sold products throughout the world and purchases certain of its components from third-\nparty international suppliers. Export sales made from the United States are principally U.S. dollar denominated. At times, export sales may be denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. A majority of the Company\u2019s revenue generated from operations outside the United States is denominated in local currency. Accordingly, these sales are not typically subject to significant foreign currency transaction risk. The Company\u2019s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the Euro, the Brazilian real, the South African rand, the Turkish lira, and the Chinese renminbi in relation to the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures, which can adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Based on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended August 31, 2020, the Company estimates the potential decrease in operating income from a ten percent adverse change in the underlying exchange rates, in U.S. dollar terms, would be approximately $0.6 million.\nIn order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company, at times, may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of its operations. This activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory, sales of finished goods, intercompany transactions and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. The Company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding that are designated as hedging instruments as of August 31, 2020.\nITEM 8", "summary": "A - The Company uses certain financial derivatives to mitigate its exposure to volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nCommodity Price Risk\nA substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle. We try to protect against such instability through various business strategies. Our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable. We use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products. Based on our open derivative positions on ethane at December 31, 2019, a hypothetical $0.10 increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have increased our income before income taxes by $11 million. Based on our open derivative positions on ethylene (which are related to OpCo's third party sales), at December 31, 2019, a hypothetical $0.10 decrease in the price of a pound of ethylene would have increased our income before income taxes by $9 million.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt. At December 31, 2019, we had $3,489 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt. We are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced. If interest rates were 1.0% higher at the time of refinancing, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $35 million. Also, at December 31, 2019, we had $11 million principal amount of variable rate debt outstanding, which represents the tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds. We do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt, but we may do so in the future. The average variable interest rate for our variable rate debt of $11 million as of December 31, 2019 was 1.78%. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in the interest expense.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for borrowings under our revolving line of credit, which is currently undrawn. LIBOR is set to be phased out at the end of 2021. We are currently reviewing how the LIBOR phase out will affect us, but we do not expect the impact to be material.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our international operations. However, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates caused by our international operations has not had a material impact on our overall operating results. We may engage in activities to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in certain instances through the use of currency exchange derivative instruments, including forward exchange contracts, cross-currency swaps or spot purchases. A forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified currencies at a stated exchange rate on a stated date. A cross-currency swap obligates us to make periodic payments in the local currency and receive periodic payments in our functional currency based on the notional amount of the instrument. In January 2018, we entered into foreign exchange hedging contracts designated as net investment hedges with an aggregate notional value of \u20ac220 million designed to reduce the volatility in stockholders' equity from changes in currency exchange rates associated with our net investments in foreign operations. In July 2019, we terminated a portion of the foreign exchange hedging contract with a notional value of \u20ac70 million. The notional value of the remaining net investment hedges was \u20ac150 million at December 31, 2019. The arrangement is scheduled to mature in 2026.\nIn July 2019, we completed the registered public offering of \u20ac700 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% Senior Notes.

We have never mined, milled, manufactured or marketed asbestos; rather, we made and provided to industrial users a limited number of products that contained encapsulated asbestos, but we stopped manufacturing these products in the late 1980s. In virtually all of the cases against us, the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages above a jurisdictional minimum against multiple defendants who may have manufactured, sold or used asbestos-containing products to which the plaintiffs were allegedly exposed and from which they purportedly suffered injury. Most of these cases are being litigated in Maryland, Illinois, Missouri and New York; however, we are also defending cases in other states. We intend to vigorously defend these cases, primarily on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to establish compensable loss as a result of exposure to our products.

Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nExposure to changes in interest rates results from borrowing activities used to fund operations. For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes affect the fair value of financial instruments but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. We have both fixed and floating rate financing. Some of our floating rate credit facilities contain minimum rates of interest to be charged. Based upon our interest-bearing balances and interest rates as of January 31, 2019, holding other variables constant, a one percentage point increase in interest rates for the next 12-month period would decrease pre-tax earnings and cash flow by approximately $1.2 million. Conversely, a one percentage point decrease in interest rates for the next 12-month period would result in an increase to pre-tax earnings and cash flow of approximately $1.2 million. At January 31, 2019, we had total floorplan payables of $273.8 million, of which $122.1 million was interest-bearing at variable interest rates and $151.7 million was non-interest bearing. In addition, at January 31, 2019, we had total long-term debt, including our Senior Convertible Notes, of $74.4 million, all of which was fixed rate debt.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur foreign currency exposures arise as the result of our foreign operations. We are exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk through our foreign entities\u2019 holding assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk as a result of certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company attempts to manage its transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, or through natural hedging instruments. Based upon balances and exchange rates as of January 31, 2019, holding other variables constant, we believe that a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in all applicable foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. As of January 31, 2019, our Ukrainian subsidiary had $3.0 million of net monetary assets denominated in Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH). We have attempted to minimize our net monetary asset position through reducing overall asset levels in Ukraine and through borrowing in UAH which serves as a natural hedging instrument offsetting our net UAH denominated assets. At certain times, currency and payment controls imposed by the National Bank of Ukraine have limited our ability to manage our net monetary asset position. While the UAH remained relatively stable in fiscal 2019, an escalation of political tensions or economic instability could lead to significant UAH devaluations, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk, we are also exposed to translational foreign currency exchange rate risk as we translate the results of operations and assets and liabilities of our foreign operations from their functional currency to the U.S. dollar. As a result, our results of operations, cash flows and net investment in our foreign operations may be adversely impacted by fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in all applicable foreign exchange rates, holding all other variables constant, would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. A discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below.\nBHGE LLC 2019 FORM 10-K | 38\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nAll of our long-term debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments. We are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio. We may use interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.\n(1)\nFair market value of our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019.\n(2)\nAmounts represent the principal value of our long-term debt outstanding and related weighted average interest rates at the end of the respective period.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK\nWe conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies, and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency. As such, future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies.\nAdditionally, we buy, manufacture and sell components and products across global markets. These activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses. When the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates, it will affect the revenue earned on the sale. These sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates. Changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing. We use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures, where appropriate.\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts. We had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with net notional amounts aggregating $1.8 billion and $2.8 billion to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates that a 1% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar would result in an impact of less than $5 million to our pre-tax earnings, however, the Company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure, where there are liquid financial markets, through use of foreign currency derivative transactions.

{"section": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nA lawsuit filed by the Company and Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Gregg E. Zahn, in 2013 against former Company Board of Directors member Wayne Pettigrew and Mr. Pettigrew's company, Group & Pension Planners, Inc. (the \"Defendants\"), concluded on February 17, 2017. The lawsuit was filed in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma (Case No. CJ-2013-03385). In the lawsuit, the Company alleged that Mr. Pettigrew had defamed the Company by making untrue statements to certain shareholders of the Company, to the press and to regulators of the state of Oklahoma and had breached his fiduciary duties. Mr. Pettigrew denied the allegations.\nThe jury concluded that Mr. Pettigrew, while still a member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, did, in fact, make untrue statements regarding the Company and Mr. Zahn and committed breaches of his fiduciary duties to the Company and the jury awarded the Company $800,000 of damages against Mr. Pettigrew. In addition, the jury found that Mr. Pettigrew had defamed Mr. Zahn and intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Mr. Zahn and awarded Mr. Zahn $3,500,000 of damages against Mr. Pettigrew. In addition to the damages awarded by the jury, the Company and Mr. Zahn have initiated steps to aggressively communicate the correction of the untrue statements to outside parties.\nMr. Pettigrew appealed this decision. The appeal challenged two trial court judgments based on separate verdicts against him in the jury trial. On February 28, 2020, the Court of Civil Appeals of the state of Oklahoma reversed the judgments entered by the trial court and remanded the case for a new trial. The Court of Appeals reversal, however, is not final. The Company will request that the Court of Appeals grant a rehearing and reverse its decision. Should it not do so, the Company will petition the Oklahoma Supreme Court to reverse the Court of Appeals decision.\nIn 2013, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, represented by independent counsel, concluded that there was no action to be taken against Mr. Zahn and that the allegations by Mr. Pettigrew were without substance. The Company was also informed back in 2013 by the Oklahoma Insurance Department that it would take no action and was also informed in 2013 that the Oklahoma Department of Securities, after its investigation of the allegations, concluded that no proceedings were needed with respect to the alleged matters. It remains the Company\u2019s intention to again vigorously prosecute this action against the Defendants for damages and for correction of the defamatory statements. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s management, the ultimate resolution of any contingencies that may arise from this litigation is not considered material in relation to the financial position or results of operations of the Company.\nPrior to being acquired by TLIC, FBLIC developed, marketed, and sold life insurance products known as \u201cDecreasing Term to 95\u201d policies. On January 17, 2013, FBLIC\u2019s Board of Directors voted that, effective March 1, 2013, it was not approving, and therefore was not providing, a non-guaranteed dividend for the Decreasing Term to 95 policies since that group of policies was not producing a positive divisible surplus to allow the payment of a non-guaranteed dividend.\nOn November 22, 2013, a lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of Greene County, Missouri asserting claims by two individuals and a class of Missouri residents against FBLIC relating to this decision to not pay a non-guaranteed dividend. A trial was held November 27, 2017 through December 1, 2017 regarding those class and individual claims. During 2018, a settlement was reached by the parties and the Court approved the settlement agreement on June 11, 2018.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and market prices such as those related to interest rates. We actively monitor these exposures and manage such risks through our regular operating and financing activities or through the use of derivative financial instruments.\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt, cash equivalents, which consist primarily of funds invested in U.S. government money-market funds, our cash flow hedges and our Rabbi trust.\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt will impact our Secured Credit Facility. The interest expense associated with our term loans and any loans under our Revolving Credit Facility will vary with market rates. A hypothetical interest rate increase of 1% would have increased interest expense related to the term facilities under our Secured Credit Facility by approximately $14.8 million in fiscal 2019 and $14.9 million in fiscal 2018, and likewise decreased our income and cash flows. The year over year increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in 1 Month LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate attached to our floating rate debt, which rose approximately 60 basis points throughout fiscal 2019, further contributing to the Company\u2019s increased interest expense. This increase in LIBOR was partially offset with a 25 basis point reduction in our Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility credit spreads as part of the Sixth Amendment consummated on July 23, 2018, along with amounts reclassified into interest expense relating to our cash flow hedges.\nAs of March 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $284.0 million and $287.0 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. The return on our cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 was less than 3%. Therefore, the corresponding impact to our interest income, and likewise to our income and cash flow, was not material.\nPursuant to our interest rate risk management strategies, we began using interest rate cash flow hedges in April 2017 to add stability to our incurrence of interest rate expense and to manage our exposure to related interest rate movement. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. As of March 31, 2019, we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600 million, $150 million of which are forward starting with a start date of April 30, 2019. These derivative instruments hedge the variability of cash outflows for interest payments on our variable rate debt and are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. As of March 31, 2019, a 25 basis point increase in interest rates would increase the fair value of our interest rate swaps by approximately $1.2 million and a 25 basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swaps by approximately $7.1 million.\nWe established a Rabbi trust to provide for the payment of benefits under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan that became effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. As of March 31, 2019, fund assets totaled $3.2 million which include mutual fund investments that are subject to fluctuations in market prices and interest rates. Cash distributions made to plan participants are recognized as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows and have the effect of lowering both fund assets and the corresponding fund liabilities on a one-for-one basis. Changes in fair value on fund liabilities offset the changes in fair value of fund assets, and changes in fair value on both fund assets and fund liabilities are recognized in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates.\nWe may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk. We use interest rate swap agreements, for example, to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixed-rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. We use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See the discussion under Note 8, \u201cDerivative and Hedging Activities,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for certain quantitative details related to the interest rate swaps.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOutstanding Debt\nThe following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on the fair value of our total outstanding debt. Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt. Discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages payable. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. This analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt, such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change. This analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.\nFixed Interest Rate Debt\nExcept as described below, all of our outstanding debt obligations (maturing at various times through May 2029) have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates. However, interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2019, we had $1.112 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding with an estimated fair value of $1.142 billion. If interest rates at December 31, 2019 had been 1.0% higher, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately $3.4 million. If interest rates at December 31, 2019 had been 1.0% lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately $26.0 million.\nVariable Interest Rate Debt\nGenerally, we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2019, we had $250.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding. We have entered into term loans that have interest rates that contain both fixed and variable components. See the discussion under Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details related to the interest rate swaps and for a discussion on how we value derivative financial instruments. Based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms, if market interest rates increased 1.0%, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately nil with a corresponding decrease in our net income and cash flows for the year. Conversely, if market rates decreased 1.0%, our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately nil with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "ITEM 7A discusses the market risk associated with the company's financial instruments.

On May 6, 2019, the court appointed Andrej Hornak as lead plaintiff and approved Pomerantz LLP as lead counsel and Andrews DeValerio LLP as liaison counsel. On July 24, 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint also names Michael Needle as a defendant. The amended complaint purports to be brought on behalf of shareholders who purchased our common stock between May 4, 2017 through January 31, 2019. It generally alleges that we and our officers violated Sections 10(b) and/or 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by failing to disclose and/or making allegedly false and/or misleading statements about the estimated dates by which we would report the topline results from the TIVO-3 trial, the preliminary overall survival results from the TIVO-3 trial, the sufficiency of the overall survival data from the TIVO-3 trial, the timing of the NDA submission, and the risk of FDA approval.

On December 4, 2019, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, and on January 15, 2020, we filed a reply in support of our motion to dismiss. We deny any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to its international sales, production, and funding requirements.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments. It is the Company's policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting and other strategies cannot be effectively employed.\nThe Company's objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its portfolio of borrowings. The Company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage, which is set by policy, or as may be required by certain loan agreements.\nThe Company's objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes. The Company enters into forward exchange contracts and options to hedge its exposure for merchandise purchased in U.S. dollars that will be sold to customers in other currencies. The Company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts and options to hedge significant inter- company assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies. Accordingly, these contracts change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of these assets, liabilities, and merchandise purchases. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures.\nIt is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nThe Company prepared a sensitivity analysis of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates of all financial instruments. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar on all financial instruments. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company's financial instruments, a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates from year-end 2000 levels would reduce the fair value of the\ninterest rate swaps by $12.6 million and a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates would reduce the fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts and options by $43.7 million.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe following discussion about the Company's market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward- looking statements. The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company generally does not use derivative instruments. At March 31, 2000 the Company had purchased $3 million of forward contracts in anticipation of a European capacity expansion.\nThe Company maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents, with maturities of three months or less as of the date of purchase. The Company also has current marketable securities consisting primarily of municipal bonds and commercial paper that are of limited credit risk and have contractual maturities of less than two years. Given the short-term nature of these investments, the Company is not subject to significant interest rate risk.\nA portion of the Company's operations consists of sales activities in foreign markets. The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States and sells them outside the U.S. through a combination of international distributors and eight wholly owned sales offices. Sales to third party distributors and to the wholly owned sales offices are in U.S. dollars. The sales offices invoice their customers in their local currency.\nAs a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in those foreign markets. The principal exposure on sales to third party distributors stems from the potential for weak economic conditions in the foreign market, thus weakening the foreign currency, decreasing the customer's buying power and potentially decreasing the Company's sales. The Company's exposure on sales to its subsidiaries consists of 1) the exposure related to the weakening of local currency when payment of the trade payable is made, thus translating into more local currency needed to pay off the U.S. denominated payable than when it was recorded, lowering the subsidiaries' earnings, and 2) upon translation of the subsidiaries' monthly financial statements, that a weakening local currency would cause lower market sales to be recorded in U.S. dollars that what have occurred had the currency been stable as compared to the U.S. dollar. However, in the latter instance, operating expenses would also be translated at lower amounts and accordingly, the effect on net income would be mitigated.

{"section": "ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES OF MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in inflation and interest rates. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding these risks.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe believe that inflation over the last three fiscal years has not had a significant impact on our operations; however, we cannot assure you there will be no such effect in the future. Our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and utilities, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Additionally, the cost of remodeling acquired retail locations and constructing new retail locations is subject to inflationary increase in the costs of labor and material, which results in higher rent expense on new retail locations. Finally, we finance substantially all of our inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on various benchmarks. Such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our Floor Plan Facility and our Real Estate Facility, which carry variable interest rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities includes the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility with advances tied to a borrowing base and which bear interest at variable rates. Additionally, under our Floor Plan Facilities we have the ability to draw on revolving floor plan arrangements,\nwhich bear interest at variable rates. Because our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Floor Plan Facility and Real Estate Facility bear interest at variable rates, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility aside from letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $4.1 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility; $1.1 billion of variable rate debt outstanding under our Term Loan Facility, net of $4.3 million of unamortized original issue discount and $10.7 million of finance costs; $848.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our Floor Plan Facility, and $40.9 million under the Floor Plan Facility revolving line of credit; and $19.5 million in borrowings under our Real Estate Facility, net of $0.2 million of unamortized finance costs. Based on December 31, 2019 debt levels, an increase or decrease of 1% in the effective interest rate would cause an increase or decrease in interest expense under our Term Loan Facility of $11.8 million or $11.3 million, respectively, over the next 12 months, an increase or decrease of 1% in the effective rate would cause an increase or decrease in interest under our Floor Plan Facility of approximately $8.9 million over the next 12 months, and an increase or decrease of 1% in the effective rate would cause an increase or decrease in interest under our Real Estate Facility of approximately $0.2 million over the next 12 months.

Due to financial limitations, our operations had been limited to conceptual planning.\nOur current business plan is to seek new business opportunities or to engage in a business combination with another company. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company\u2019s management. As of the date of this report, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company.\nCorporate Background\nZhong Ya International Limited was incorporated under the name \u201cWestern Lucrative Enterprises, Inc.\u201d (\u201cWLUC\u201d) pursuant to the laws of the State of Iowa on July 14, 2008. In May 2018, WLUC formed a wholly-owned subsidiary pursuant to the laws of Nevada under the name of \u201cZhong Ya International Limited\u201d (\u201cZhong Ya\u201d). As described in more details below, on July 3, 2018, WLUC merged into Zhong Ya, with Zhong Ya being the surviving entity. In connection with the merger, each 100 outstanding shares of common stock of WLUC was exchanged for 1 share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d) of Zhong Ya. This report gives retroactive effect to such share exchange.\nFebruary 2018 Change of Control\nWLUC entered into a debt assumption and conversion agreement, dated January 31, 2018 with Magellan Capital Partners, Inc. (\u201cMagellan\u201d), pursuant to which $30,815 in accounts payables and accrued expenses owed to Magellan, as well as $6,000 in a note and $1,526 in accrued interest, were converted into 102,300 shares of WLUC\u2019s common stock issued to a designee of Magellan.\nOn January 31, 2018, Wenjian Liu, as buyer, entered into a stock purchase agreement (the \u201cSPA\u201d) with Dempsey Mork, Tonbridge, LLC and Magellan Capital Corp. 401K Profit Sharing Plan, as sellers. Pursuant to the SPA, on February 12, 2018, Wenjian Liu purchased 169,300 shares of WLUC\u2019s common stock for a total purchase price of $325,000 in cash, and as a result, became a controlling shareholder of WLUC.\nMerger with Zhong Ya and Name Change\nOn June 1, 2018, WLUC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (\u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Zhong Ya, pursuant to which, WLUC merged with and into Zhong Ya (the \u201cMerger\u201d) and the separate existence of WLUC ceased and Zhang Ya survived the Merger and continues to be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada. Upon completion of the Merger, each one hundred (100) shares of WLUC\u2019s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger were converted into one (1) share of Common Stock of Zhang Ya (\u201cZhong Ya Shares\u201d). Any fractional Zhong Ya Share a shareholder would have received was rounded up and an additional whole Zhong Ya Share was issued for such fractional Zhong Ya Share. This report gives retroactive effect to the share exchange.\nThe Articles of Merger were filed with the State of Nevada on July 2, 2018 and with the State of Iowa on July 3, 2018. The Merger became effective on July 3, 2018. The post-Merger Company adopted the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Zhong Ya.\nOn September 28, 2018, the Company effected a change in the Company\u2019s name from \u201cWestern Lucrative Enterprises, Inc.\u201d to \u201cZhong Ya International Limited.\u201d\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no employees other than our sole officer and director.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk, which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates. We do not believe that our exposure to market risks, which are primarily related to interest rate changes, is material.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe maintain certain debt instruments at a fixed rate whose fair value will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and market perception of our credit risk. The fair value of our debt at December 31, 2020 and 2019 approximated the book value.\nWe entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.50% through August 29, 2024. In February 2020, we entered into the second swap agreement of $25 million, under which we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 1.3% through February 28, 2025. Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are highly effective. Unrealized losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in income as an increase or decrease to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense.\nOur Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus 1.500% to a maximum of LIBOR plus 2.875% and includes a LIBOR floor of 0.500%. As a result of the two interest rate swap agreements, we are subject to interest rate risk on debt in excess of $50 million drawn on our Credit Facility. At December 31, 2020, we had an outstanding balance of $111 million. A 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe operate in a number of international areas which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We do not currently hold or issue forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes (a foreign exchange contract is an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate). Foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar (\"USD\") against foreign currencies and are included in other (income) expense in the statements of operations. We recognized foreign exchange losses in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency, as well as in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local\ncurrency. We recognized foreign exchange gains in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency, as well as in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency.\nCredit Risk\nOur financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Substantially all cash and cash equivalents are on deposit at commercial banks or investment firms. Our trade receivables are with a variety of domestic, international and national oil and gas companies. Management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the creditworthiness and financial resources of these financial institutions and companies.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rate changes, but does not believe it is material.

Legal Proceedings\nIn September 2018, a complaint was filed in San Diego Superior Court for a breach of contract arising from a subsequent agreement regarding the purchase of a judgment for the matter of Svenston Buelow and Amanda Eliot v. GlobalTel Media. The purchase of the judgment was part of the transaction in which we acquired our IP portfolio from GlobalTel Media. We substantially performed under the original agreement, but the plaintiffs alleged we breached the subsequent agreement which was executed to extend the final payment. On October 26, 2018, we filed an answer that denied each and every purported allegation and cause of action, further denied that they caused any damage or loss and asserted the affirmative defense of duress. We recorded as a liability as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 in the amount of $135,000 and $175,000, respectively. On December 3, 2019, the parties entered into a conditional settlement agreement whereby we agreed to pay $150,000 on a payment schedule ending October 1, 2020. Should the repayment enter default without being cured, the court shall order an entry of judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs in the amount of $175,000 less any amounts paid under the settlement, plus pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs and reasonable attorney fees. As of March 24, 2020, we are current on the payment schedule.\nIn September 2018, the landlord for our former office space lease filed a limited civil lawsuit against us in the State of California. We reached an agreement that resulted in a stipulation for judgment on October 28, 2018. The stipulated judgment was for $42,432 including attorney fees and court costs plus interest for which we recorded as a liability as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The stipulated judgment was paid in full on August 16, 2019.\nIn July 2018, a former Board of Director\u2019s member filed a lawsuit, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging various claims for relief. We reached an agreement, with no consideration paid, that resulted in a voluntary dismissal with prejudice and dismissed all claims on November 14, 2018.\nIn November 2017, two shareholders of AppTech, one who previously filed a 2014 lawsuit in the State of Washington, filed another lawsuit against us in the State of California, claiming the same accusations as the previously filed lawsuit which was dismissed. The lawsuit has been transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. We filed an answer, affirmative defenses and counter claims. Management believes that the Plaintiff misrepresented and mislead us during the merger between ourselves and Transcendent One, Inc. The court has encouraged the parties to settle. Even though the Company believes the lawsuit is without merit and will vigorously defend, the Company has made several offers to settle. On December 19, 2019, the Company entered into a settlement and release agreement. The Company has recorded the liability as of December 31, 2019 for the total obligation of $240,000 to be paid out over three years beginning February 15, 2020.

The first payment of $20,000 due February 15, 2020 has been paid timely.\nIn March 2016, a significant shareholder (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) of ours filed a lawsuit against us in the state of California alleging breach of contract, fraud and negligent misrepresentation based on supposed oral promises in 2013 to give Plaintiff\u2019s company shares in exchange for stock in another company and a 2014 consulting agreement. We strongly disputed all claims made in the lawsuit. On April 20, 2017, we filed an answer that denied each and every purported allegation and cause of action and further denied that they caused any damage or loss. We reached an agreement resulting in a voluntary dismissal of the civil case on July 5, 2017.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were exposed to market risks associated with interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk. As of December 31, 2019, $122.5 million of our outstanding debt was subject to floating rates. The interest rate applicable to our variable rate debt may continue to rise, thereby increasing our interest expense and related cash outlay. In June 2015, we entered into various interest rate swap contracts to fix the interest rate on a portion of the Nordea Q5000 Loan. These swap contracts, which are settled monthly, began in June 2015 and extend through April 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the interest rate on $67.0 million of the Nordea Q5000 Loan was hedged. Debt subject to variable rates after considering hedging activities was $55.5 million. The impact of interest rate risk is estimated using a hypothetical increase in interest rates by 100 basis points for our variable rate long-term debt that is not hedged. Based on this hypothetical assumption, we would have incurred an additional $0.6 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. Because we operate in various regions around the world, we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, our earnings are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates when (i) transactions are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant Helix entity, or (ii) the functional currency of our subsidiaries is not the U.S. dollar. In order to mitigate the effects of exchange rate risk in areas outside the U.S., we endeavor to pay a portion of our expenses in local currencies to partially offset revenues that are denominated in the same local currencies. In addition, a substantial portion of our contracts provide for collections from customers in U.S. dollars.\nAssets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, resulting in translation adjustments that are reflected in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss\u201d in the shareholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2019, approximately 15% of our assets were impacted by changes in foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded foreign currency translation gains (losses) of $5.4 million, $(7.2) million and $16.3 million, respectively, to accumulated other comprehensive loss. Deferred taxes have not been provided on foreign currency translation adjustments since we consider our undistributed earnings (when applicable) of our non-U.S. subsidiaries without operations in the U.S. to be permanently reinvested.\nWhen currencies other than the functional currency are to be paid or received, the resulting transaction gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of \u201cOther income (expense), net.\u201d For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $1.5 million, $(4.3) million and $(2.2) million, respectively, primarily related to our subsidiaries in the U.K.\nIn February 2013, we entered into various foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure with respect to the Grand Canyon II and Grand Canyon III charter payments denominated in the Norwegian kroner. The contracts related to the Grand Canyon II charter payments were fully settled through July 2019 and the contracts related to the Grand Canyon III charter payments were fully settled through February 2020.

Our cash and cash equivalents generate interest income that will vary based on changes in short-term interest rates. In addition, we have swapped our fixed-rate debt to floating-rate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with short-term interest rates. Refer to Note 5, Derivative Instruments, and Note 6, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our interest rate swaps.\nAs of February 1, 2020, we had $2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of debt that has been swapped to floating rate, and therefore the net balance exposed to interest rate changes was $1.0 billion. As of February 1, 2020, a 50-basis point increase in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $5 million reduction in net interest expense, and conversely a 50-basis point decrease in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $5 million increase in net interest expense.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. On a limited basis, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases, recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our Canadian operations. Our primary objective in\nholding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows, as well as net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Refer to Note 5, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these instruments.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar compared to the prior-year period, which had a negative overall impact on our revenue as our Canadian dollar revenue translated into fewer U.S. dollars.

Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as our non-U.S. sales are recorded by our subsidiaries located in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico and as we incur significant operating expenses in our foreign subsidiaries including our research and development facilities in Hungary, Germany, and Canada and our sales and marketing operations in Ireland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia and Brazil. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, approximately 24%, 22% and 21%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by customers outside of the United States and approximately 21%, 22% and 24%, respectively, of our operating expenses occurred in our international operations.\nCurrently, our largest exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to the Euro, British Pound, Israeli Shekel, Hungarian Forint, the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar. To date, changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our operations, and we estimate that a change of 10% or less in foreign currency exchange rates would not materially affect our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2019, we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts equivalent to the following:\nNet realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses were net losses of $0.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, which are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Excluding the underlying foreign currency exposure being hedged, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward contracts included in foreign currency gains and losses was a net loss of $0.3 million for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2019, and a net gain of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents totaled $128.0 million, of which $62.2 million was held in the United States and $65.8 million was held by our international subsidiaries. Our invested cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations and, for non-U.S. operations, foreign currency risk. Our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by $8.1 million in 2017, and unfavorably by $6.8 million and $1.4 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively, due to changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly the Euro.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. Interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. However, based on the nature and current level of our cash and cash equivalents, which typically consist of cash, money market instruments and corporate debt securities with maturities of three months or less, we believe there is no material risk of exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents as a result of changes in interest rates.\nInterest expense on borrowings under our credit facility is sensitive to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had $200.0 million outstanding under our variable-rate credit facility. Interest rates on this loan will be adjusted at each rollover date to the extent such amounts are not repaid. As of December 31, 2019, the annual rate on the loan was 3.313%. If there was a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates, the annual net impact to earnings and cash flows would be $2.0 million.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe have market risk exposure related to fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In an effort to manage our exposure to these risks, we may enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change. We expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders' equity.\nThe following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel, the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk. For these and other reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results.\nFuel Price Risk\nChanges in fuel prices materially impact our results of operations. A one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately $40 million of additional annual fuel expense. Our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to Monroe\u2019s inventory.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our debt obligations. Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $7.6 billion of fixed-rate debt and $2.9 billion of variable-rate debt. An increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $300 million at December 31, 2019 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variable-rate debt by $29 million.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in July 2017 that it intends to no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the London interbank offered rate (\"LIBOR\") after 2021. To mitigate the possible impact, various regulators have proposed alternative reference rates. The effect of any discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time, but we believe our risk would be limited to variable rate debt and variable rate finance leases which utilize this rate. At December 31, 2019 we have approximately $2.1 billion of variable rate finance leases and variable rate debt maturing after 2021, that include provisions to update the applicable reference rate which are not expected to be materially different from LIBOR.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue, expense and equity investments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage exchange rate risk, we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had open a U.S. dollar-Euro cross currency swap contract totaling a $9 million asset position. We estimate that a 10% depreciation or appreciation in the price of the Euro in relation to the U.S. dollar would have changed the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contract by $45 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, we had open a U.S. dollar-South Korean won cross currency swap contract totaling a $3 million liability position.

It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending actions, and as with any litigation, it is possible that these actions could be decided unfavorably to the Company. We believe that there are meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, and where appropriate, these actions are being vigorously contested.\nWe are the subject of civil actions, or have received notices from the EPA or state agencies with similar responsibility, that we and numerous other parties are considered a PRP and may be obligated under CERCLA, or similar state statutes, to pay for the cost of remedial investigation, feasibility studies and ultimately remediation to correct alleged releases of hazardous substances at eleven locations. The actions and notices refer to the following locations, none of which involve real estate we ever owned or upon which we ever conducted operations: the Sapp Battery Site in Cottondale, Florida, the Interstate Lead Company Site in Leeds, Alabama, the Ross Metals Site in Rossville, Tennessee, the Li Tungsten Site in Glen Cove, New York, the Peak Oil Site in Tampa, Florida, the R&H Oil Site in San Antonio, Texas, the SoGreen/Parramore Site in Tifton, Georgia, the Jensen Drive site in Houston, Texas, the Industrial Salvage site in Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chemetco site in Hartford, Illinois and the Ward Transformer site in Raleigh, North Carolina. We may contest our designation as a PRP with regard to certain sites, while at other sites we are participating with other named PRPs in agreements or negotiations that have resulted or that we expect will result in agreements to remediate the sites. During 2010, we acquired a 70% interest in the real property at Jensen Drive as part of the remediation of that site. We have periodically received information requests from government environmental agencies with regard to other sites that are apparently under consideration for designation as listed sites under CERCLA or similar state statutes. Often we do not receive any further communication with regard to these sites, and as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not know if any of these inquiries will ultimately result in a demand for payment from us.\nThe EPA notified us and other alleged PRPs that under Section 106 of CERCLA, we and the other PRPs could be subject to a maximum fine of $25,000 per day and the imposition of treble damages if we and the other PRPs refuse to clean up the Peak Oil, Sapp Battery and SoGreen/Parramore sites as ordered by the EPA.

Hanson, director and vice president, finance; Donghai Shi, director and executive vice president; Ronaldo Panida, director; Lili Fan, Secretary; and Ting Wang executive assistant.\nResults of Operations during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018\nWe have not generated any revenues during the 2019 and 2018 fiscal years. We have operating expenses related to general and administrative expenses being a public company and interest expenses. We incurred $20,042 of administrative costs and net loss for the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to $15,963 in net loss due to expenses consisting of general and administrative expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn June 30, 2019, we had $3,000 cash on hand and had a current liability payable to a related party of $40,029 compared to cash on hand of $3,000, accounts payable of $1,024 and $18,963 owing to the same related party, at June 30, 2018.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019 a related party paid $21,066 directly to vendors for the cost of administering the public company. That same related party loaned $3,000 unsecured, and non-interest bearing, to the company. We had a negative cash flow from operations of $21,066 during the year ended June 30, 2019 due to a net loss of $20,042 and a decrease in accounts payable of $1,024. We financed our negative cash flow from operations during the year ended June 30, 2019 through advances of $21,066 made by the related party, who paid vendors directly.\nThe Company currently plans to satisfy its cash requirements for the next 12 months through borrowings from its majority shareholders or a related party and believes it can satisfy its cash requirements so long as it is able to obtain financing from its controlling shareholders. The Company expects that money borrowed will be used during the next 12 months to satisfy the Company's operating costs, professional fees and for general corporate purposes.\nThe Company has only limited capital.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company\u2019s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to its debt. There is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the Company\u2019s future financing requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $384.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding. The Company has primarily used fixed-rate debt and forward starting interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. See the discussion under Note 11, \u201cDerivative and Hedging Activities,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for certain quantitative details related to the interest rate swaps.\nThe Company entered into interest rate swaps in order to economically hedge against the risk of rising interest rates that would affect the Company\u2019s interest expense related to its future anticipated debt issuances as part of its overall borrowing program. The sensitivity analysis table presented below shows the estimated instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve up and down by 50 and 100 basis points, respectively, on the clean market value of its interest rate derivatives as of December 31, 2019, exclusive of non-performance risk (in thousands).\nSee Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion on how the Company values derivative financial instruments. The Company calculates the value of its interest rate swaps based upon the present value of the future cash flows expected to be paid and received on each leg of the swap. The cash flows on the fixed leg of the swap are agreed to at inception and the cash flows on the floating leg of a swap change over time as interest rates change. To estimate the floating cash flows at each valuation date, the Company utilizes a forward curve which is constructed using LIBOR fixings, Eurodollar futures, and swap rates, which are observable in the market. Both the fixed and floating legs\u2019 cash flows are discounted at market discount factors. For purposes of adjusting its derivative valuations, the Company incorporates the nonperformance risk for both itself and its counterparties to these contracts based upon management\u2019s estimates of credit spreads, credit default swap spreads (if available) or IHS Markit ratings in order to derive a curve that considers the term structure of credit.\nAs a corporation that has elected to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010, ROIC\u2019s future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The Company will be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire properties. The Company\u2019s interest rate risk management objectives will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, the Company expects to borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and, in some cases, with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates. In addition, the Company can use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The Company will not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and will only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors. Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.

We continue to experience foreign currency fluctuations primarily due to the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our revenues and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. For our fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had a foreign currency loss of $2.1 million, gain of $1.2 million and loss of $1.0 million, respectively.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.

This amount was invested primarily in U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, foreign government bonds, and money market funds. The cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates, which could affect our results of operations. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our marketable securities as \u201cavailable for sale,\u201d no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.\nAn immediate increase of 100-basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $3.0 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2019. An immediate decrease of 100-basis points in interest rates would have increased the market value by $3.0 million as of January 31, 2019. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.

Any claims or regulatory actions against J2 Global and its affiliates, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming and costly, and could divert significant operational resources. The outcomes of such matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, carrying the potential for unfavorable rulings that could include monetary damages and injunctive relief.\nOn February 17, 2011, Emmanuel Pantelakis (\u201cPantelakis\u201d) filed suit against a J2 Global affiliate in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (No. 11-50673), alleging that the J2 Global affiliate breached a contract relating to Pantelakis\u2019s use of the Campaigner service. The J2 Global affiliate filed a responsive pleading on March 23, 2011 and responses to undertakings on July 16, 2012.

The case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas (No. 4:16-cv-00682). On March 20, 2017, the District Court granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the J2 Global affiliates and dismissed all claims against the J2 Global affiliates. On July 23, 2018, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the judgment and remanded to district court with instructions to return the case to state court. On January 29, 2019, after further appeals were exhausted, the case was remanded to the Arkansas state court. On April 1, 2019, the state court granted a motion for class certification filed by the plaintiff in 2016. Because the prior removal to federal court had deprived the state court of jurisdiction, the J2 Global affiliates had not yet filed an opposition brief to the 2016 motion when the state court granted the motion. The J2 Global affiliates appealed the order. On July 15, 2019, the J2 Global affiliates removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. On November 26, 2019, the court denied the Plaintiff\u2019s motion to remand. On December 20, 2019, the court granted the Plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to amend its complaint.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - -------- ----------------------------------------------------------\nThe Company's exposure to market risk includes, but is not limited to, the following risks: changes in interest rates on the Company's investment portfolio, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity price fluctuations. The Company also has various agreements that are classified as derivative financial instruments. (See also \"Risk Factors\" in Part I of this Form 10-K.)\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company may invest its cash in debt instruments of the United States Government and its agencies, and in high-quality corporate issuers, and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors the Company's future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the Company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. Given the relatively low amounts of cash on hand in recent quarters, the impact on the Company's revenues from changes in interest rates would be nil. The Company may in the future actively manage its exposure to interest rate risk.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe price of gold is denominated in United States dollars and the majority of the Company's revenues and expenses are denominated in United States dollars. As a result of the limited exposure, management considers that the Company is not exposed to a material risk as a result of any changes in foreign currency exchange rate changes, so the Company does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe Company is engaged in gold mining and related activities, including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. Gold bullion is the Company's primary product and, as a result, changes in the price of gold could significantly affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows. According to current estimates, a $25 change in the price of gold could result in a $2.5 million effect on the results of operations and cash flows. The Company currently does not have a program for hedging, or otherwise manage its exposure to commodity price risk. The Company may in the future manage its exposure through hedging programs.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Summary: The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we believe the primary market risk to which we have exposure is interest rate risk.\nWe are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt. Interest rate changes on our fixed rate debt will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps. To the extent we enter into such derivative financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, it does not possess credit risk. It is our policy to enter into these transactions with what we believe are high quality counterparties, including those with whom we have a lending relationship. We believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty non-performance is remote. We manage the market risk associated with interest rate swaps or caps by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nThe table below presents, as of December 31, 2019, the principal amounts of our fixed and variable debt and the weighted average interest rates, excluding the impact of cash flow hedges, by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes (in thousands, except interest rates):\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2.8 billion of gross fixed and variable rate debt with interest rates ranging from 2.75% to 4.00% per annum and a weighted average interest rate of 3.34% per annum, excluding the impact of cash flow hedges. We had $2.2 billion (excluding net premium/discount and deferred financing costs) of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.49% per annum and $600.0 million (excluding net premium/discount and deferred financing costs) of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.81% per annum as of December 31, 2019, excluding the impact of cash flow hedges.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was $2.2 billion and the fair value of our variable rate debt was $601.8 million based upon prevailing market rates as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash flow hedges outstanding that effectively fix $500.0 million of our variable rate debt.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into various derivative transactions when appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.\nForeign Currency Exchange and Other Rate Risks\nWe operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros (\"EUR\"), British pounds (\"GBP\"), Swiss francs (\"CHF\"), Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Brazilian reais, Australian dollars and Chinese yuan. We manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions. We temporarily record realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income, and then recognize them in other income or expense when the hedged item affects net earnings.\nFrom time to time, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity\u2019s functional currency. As a result, the impact of foreign currency gains/losses recognized in earnings are partially offset by gains/losses on the related foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. Refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments for further information.\nWe maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. With respect to derivatives, changes in hedged items are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. Consequently, foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements, because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities or transactions being hedged.\nThe results of operations discussed herein have not been materially affected by inflation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nCash and Cash Equivalents - We are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. A hypothetical 100 basis points movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents outstanding at December 31, 2019 would increase interest income by approximately $2.0 million on an annual basis. No significant decrease in interest income would be expected as our cash balances are earning interest at rates of approximately 2 basis points. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to cash balances maintained in foreign currencies.\nDebt - Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar LIBOR-indexed borrowings. We use interest rate swap derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. These interest rate swaps fix the interest rate on a portion of our expected LIBOR-indexed floating-rate borrowings. The Company held the following interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2019 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThese interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2019. The total notional amount of interest rate swaps in effect as of December 31, 2019 was $900 million.

Zember Jr., seeks unspecified damages and other relief related to asserted claims for fraudulent inducement and breach of contract based on the Bank\u2019s alleged failure to provide sufficient assistance to CEBV in collecting on loans purchased by CEBV from the Bank.\nIn addition, on January 30, 2019, the Company and the Bank filed a lawsuit against Mr. Villari in Dekalb County, Georgia, asserting claims for unspecified damages arising from Mr. Villari\u2019s alleged failure to disclose material information in connection with the sale of USPF to the Company and the Bank.\nIn the first of these proceedings to be adjudicated, the Company and the Bank received on November 20, 2019, an Order and Award from the American Arbitration Association in which the arbitrator ruled that the Company and the Bank had cause to terminate Mr. Villari and had properly exercised that right and that, as a result, Mr. Villari is not entitled to any additional payments under his employment agreement or a separate management and licensing agreement with the Bank.\nWe believe the remaining allegations of Mr. Villari, P1 and CEBV in their complaints are without merit, and we are vigorously defending the cases. We believe that the amount or any estimable range of reasonably possible or probable loss in connection with these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the Company.\nOn November 19, 2019, the Company received a subpoena from the Atlanta Regional Office of the SEC, and the Bank received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, each requesting that the Company and the Bank produce documents and other materials relating to the Company\u2019s acquisition of USPF, the Bank\u2019s sale of certain loans to CEBV and related disclosures. The Company intends to cooperate fully with the investigation and is currently producing documents in response to the subpoenas. The Company is unable to make any assurances regarding the\noutcome of the investigation or the impact, if any, that the investigation may have on the Company\u2019s business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFurthermore, from time to time, the Company and the Bank are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company and the Bank are also subject to regulatory examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business. Based on the Company\u2019s current knowledge, management presently does not believe that the liabilities arising from these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these legal matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for any particular period.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings with William J. Villari, who formerly owned USPF, and entities that Mr. Villari owns.

{"section": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nCelldex Therapeutics, Inc., which we refer to as \"Celldex,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or the \"Company,\" is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of immunotherapies and other targeted biologics. Our drug candidates are derived from a broad set of human and bispecific antibodies which have the ability to engage the human immune system and/or directly inhibit tumors to treat specific types of cancer or other diseases. They are aimed at addressing market opportunities for which we believe current therapies are inadequate or non-existent.\nWe are focusing our efforts and resources on the continued research and development of:\n\u2022 CDX-1140, an agonist monoclonal antibody targeted to CD40, a key activator of immune response, currently being studied as a single-agent and in combination with CDX-301, a dendritic cell growth factor. Dose escalation was recently completed in a Phase 1 study in solid tumors and lymphoma and the recommended dose for further study was determined to be 1.5 mg/kg for both CDX-1140 monotherapy and in combination with CDX-301. Celldex has initiated multiple expansion cohorts within the study, including a combination cohort with KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab). The Company is exploring additional combination cohorts with mechanisms that we believe could be complementary or synergistic with CDX-1140.\n\u2022 CDX-3379, a monoclonal antibody designed to block the activity of ErbB3 (HER3), currently in an early Phase 2 study in advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer in combination with Erbitux\u00ae;\n\u2022 CDX-0159, a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the KIT receptor and potently inhibits its activity, which is currently completing a Phase 1 study in healthy subjects. We plan to study CDX-0159 in mast cell driven diseases, including, initially, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticarias (CINDUs); and,\n\u2022 CDX-527, a bispecific antibody that uses our proprietary highly active anti-PD-L1 and CD27 human antibodies to couple CD27 co-stimulation with blockade of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway, for which we are planning a Phase 1 study in advanced solid tumors.\nWe routinely work with external parties to collaboratively advance our drug candidates. In addition to Celldex-led studies, we also have an Investigator Initiated Research (IIR) program with multiple studies ongoing with our drug candidates.\nOur goal is to build a fully integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. We believe our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our innovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships. This approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product. Currently, all programs are fully owned by Celldex.\nOur future success depends upon many factors, including our ability, and that of any licensees and collaborators that we may have, to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our drug candidates. We have had no commercial revenues from sales of our drug candidates, and we have had a history of operating losses. It is possible that we may not be able to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our drug candidates, and we are subject to a number of risks that you should be aware of before investing in us.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\nForeign currency exchange risk\nAlthough we report our results and financial condition in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our operating and financing activities are denominated in foreign currencies, principally the euro but also many others.\nOur U.S. subsidiaries carry significant amounts of euro-denominated debt. This does not result in any material risks from an earnings perspective because the exposure from these instruments is substantially hedged by offsetting exposures from intercompany borrowing arrangements. From a cash flow perspective, we have the risk of paying more or less cash for any optional or mandatory repayments of our euro-denominated debt that may not be offset with equivalent cash repayments of our intercompany borrowings. For example, an optional debt repayment of \u20ac100 million on December 31, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, with a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have caused us to pay an additional $12.2 million and $11.2 million, respectively, to extinguish that debt.\nChanges to foreign currency exchange rates could favorably or unfavorably affect the translation of our foreign operating results. For example, during times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings will be reduced because local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to all other currencies would have decreased net income by $4.7 million and decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $45.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to all other currencies would have increased net income by $2.6 million (due to our foreign subsidiaries reporting an aggregate net loss) and decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $38.0 million.\nInterest rate risk\nWe carry a significant amount of debt that exposes us to interest rate risk. A portion of our debt consists of variable-rate instruments. We have also issued fixed-rate secured and unsecured notes. None of our other financial instruments are subject to material interest rate risk.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had borrowings of $2,066.5 million under our credit facilities. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at variable rates based on prevailing LIBOR and EURIBOR rates in the financial markets. Changes to those market rates affect both the amount of cash we pay for interest and our reported interest expense. Our euro term loans include a zero percent floor on EURIBOR, which has been negative, so the floor provides a partial hedge of our variable interest rate risk on that loan. At December 31, 2020, a 100 basis point increase to the applicable variable rates of interest would have increased the amount of interest by $18.8 million per annum. At December 31, 2019, a 100 basis point increase to the applicable variable rates of interest would have increased the amount of interest by $9.5 million per annum.\nOur senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes bear interest at fixed rates, so their fair value will increase if interest rates fall and decrease if interest rates rise. At December 31, 2020, a 100 basis point decrease in the market rate of interest for the notes would have increased their aggregate fair value by $182.1 million. At December 31, 2019, a 100 basis point decrease in the market rate of interest for the notes would have increased their aggregate fair value by $202.0 million.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk summarizes the risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange risk can affect the translation of foreign operating results, while interest rate risk can affect the amount of cash paid for interest and the fair value of fixed-rate notes. A 100 basis point increase in variable interest rates would have increased the amount of interest paid by $18.8 million in 2020, while a 100 basis point decrease in the market rate of interest for the notes would have increased their aggregate fair value by $182.1 million in 2020."}
{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below. Our market risk discussion includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments.\nWe borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and bank term loans bear interest at variable rates. Our long-term debt, which consists of secured and unsecured long-term financings, typically bears interest at fixed rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit generally the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars, swaps, caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to existing and prospective debt instruments. We generally do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $2,284.0 million principal amount of fixed rate debt outstanding, a $248.3 million increase as compared to December 31, 2019, excluding debt with a variable rate that is effectively fixed by related interest rate hedge contracts. The estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt was $2,452.8 million. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher, the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt would have been $152.1 million lower. If interest rates had been 100 basis points lower, the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt would have been $165.6 million higher.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $150.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding, a $321.0 million decrease as compared to December 31, 2019, not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. If the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher or lower, the annual interest expense at December 31, 2020 would increase or decrease by $1.5 million.\nSee \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Financing Activities - Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.\u201d\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $50.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding with $50.0 million of related floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These swaps effectively fix the underlying one-month LIBOR rate at a weighted average rate of 1.693%. If the underlying LIBOR interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the aggregate fair market value of the swaps at December 31, 2020 would increase or decrease by $0.5 million.\nWe are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, which are major financial institutions, under the swaps. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our counterparties using publicly available information. Based on this review, we currently expect the counterparties to perform fully under the swaps. However, if a counterparty defaults on its obligations under a swap, we could be required to pay the full rates on the applicable debt, even if such rates were in excess of the rate in the contract.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the effects of potential changes in interest rates on the company's market risk.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - -------------------------------\nSubsequent to December 31, 2000, the Company and various of its executive officers were named in multiple putative securities class action complaints filed in both the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Western Districts of Oklahoma seeking unspecified damages on the basis of allegations that the Company issued false and misleading financial information, primarily related to the method the Company uses to account for commission advance receivables from sales associates. These complaints have been transferred to Western District of Oklahoma where motions to consolidate them into a single proceeding are pending. As of April 17, 2001, these cases were in the preliminary procedural stages relating to selection of lead counsel and lead plaintiffs as required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"). After the selection of lead plaintiffs and lead counsel, the Company expects that an amended and consolidated complaint will be filed. The Company expects to file a motion to dismiss the complaint. Under PSLRA, discovery is stayed during the pendency of a motion to dismiss. Costs of defense of these cases through the motion to dismiss stage are not expected to be material. While the outcome of these cases is uncertain, the Company believes these actions are without merit and will vigorously defend these actions. However, an unfavorable decision in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn January 2001, the Company received inquiries from the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requesting information relating primarily to the Company's accounting policies for commission advance receivables from sales associates. Also, in January 2001 the staff of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance reviewed the Company's 1999 Form 10-K. The Division of Enforcement's inquiry is informal and does not constitute a formal investigation or proceeding. In subsequent discussions and exchanges of correspondence the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance of the SEC raised issues regarding the Company's accounting policies and requested additional information from the Company. The Company is cooperating with the staff of the SEC in providing the requested information and expects to continue to do so. As of April 20, 2001, these inquiries were proceeding. The Company is not able to predict what the outcome of these inquiries may be or when they will be resolved. See Item 7 - Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations - Risk Factors.\nFor additional information concerning the Company's accounting policies for commission advance receivables, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations.\nThe Company is a named defendant in certain other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business.

Legal Proceedings.\nOn October 24, 2019 and November 7, 2019, purported stockholders of the Company filed two putative class action complaints in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Charles Reidinger v.

The complaints are nearly identical and allege violations of Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201c1934 Act\u201d), purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased Zendesk, Inc. common stock between February 6, 2019 and October 1, 2019, inclusive. The claims are based upon allegations that the defendants misrepresented and/or omitted material information in certain of our prior public filings. To this point, no discovery has occurred in these cases. The court has appointed lead plaintiff and has consolidated the various lawsuits into a single action (Case No. 3:19-cv-06968-CRB). It is possible that additional similar complaints or additional amended complaints may be filed. If this occurs, we do not intend to announce the filing of each additional, similar complaint or any amended complaint unless it contains allegations that are substantially distinct from those made in the pending action described above. These class actions are still in the preliminary stages, and it is not possible for the Company to quantify the extent of potential liability to the individual defendants, if any. Management believes that these lawsuits lack merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions. We cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss from the above described matters.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to other legal proceedings, claims, investigations, and government inquiries in the ordinary course of business. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights, defamation, labor and employment rights, privacy, and contractual rights. Legal risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for content added to our product and platform solutions by third parties may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners, and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Company\u2019s financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIn management\u2019s opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on business, consolidated balance sheets, results of operations, comprehensive loss, or cash flows. However, the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of\nmanagement's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nItem 4.", "summary": "Mine Safety Disclosures\n\nTwo putative class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its executive officers.

At December 31, 2019, we were a party to hedging transactions, including the use of derivative financial instruments, as discussed below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes due to our borrowing activities. Our objective is to manage the risk of interest rate changes on the results of operations, cash flows, and the market value of our debt by creating an appropriate balance between our fixed and floating-rate debt. We enter into interest rate derivative transactions from time to time, including interest rate swaps and interest rate locks, in order to maintain a level of exposure to interest rate variability that we deem acceptable.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had outstanding interest rate locks that hedge a portion of the risk of changes in the benchmark interest rate associated with long-term debt we anticipate issuing in the future. See Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\" At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we did not hold any interest rate swap contracts.\nThe following table sets forth the contractual maturities and the total fair values at December 31, 2019 for our financial instruments materially affected by interest rate risk:\n(1) Excludes $11 million of finance lease obligations and $15 million of unamortized discounts and deferred financing fees.\n(2) Average interest rate at December 31, 2019.\n(3) Includes Grand Hyatt Rio de Janeiro construction loan which had a 7.54% interest rate at December 31, 2019.\nForeign Currency Exposures and Exchange Rate Instruments\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and utilize foreign currency forward contracts to offset our exposure associated with the fluctuations of certain foreign currencies. The U.S. dollar equivalents of the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts, the majority of which relate to intercompany transactions, with terms of less than one year, were $194 million and $210 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nWe intend to offset the gains and losses related to our third-party debt and intercompany transactions with gains or losses on our foreign currency forward contracts such that there is a negligible effect on net income.

We develop our existing brands by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and strong advertising support. Acquisitions of OTC brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We pursue this growth following an acquisition through increased spending on advertising and promotional support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations and innovative development of brand extensions. Our recent acquisition and divestitures are as follows:\n\u2022On July 2, 2018, we sold the Comet\u00ae, Spic and Span\u00ae, Chore Boy\u00ae, Chlorinol\u00ae and Cinch\u00ae brands, as well as associated inventory, for approximately $65.9 million.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and pension obligations. We seek to minimize or manage these market risks through normal operating and financing activities. We do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the market fluctuations, nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying exposures.\nForeign Currency Risk. Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Canadian Dollar. Due to the relative size of our international operations to date, we have not instituted an active hedging program. We expect our international operations to continue to grow in the near term, and we are monitoring the foreign currency exposure to determine if we should begin a hedging program.\nInterest Rate Risk. In connection with our U.S. and Canadian payroll and tax filing services, we collect funds for payment of payroll and taxes; temporarily hold such funds in trust until payment is due; remit the funds to the customers\u2019 employees and appropriate taxing authority; file federal, state and local tax returns; and handle related regulatory correspondence and amendments. We invest the U.S. customer trust funds primarily in high- quality bank deposits, money market mutual funds, or collateralized short-term investments. We may also invest these funds in U.S. Treasury and agency securities, as well as highly rated asset-backed, mortgage-backed, municipal, and corporate securities. Our Canadian customer trust funds are invested in securities issued by the government and provinces of Canada, highly rated Canadian banks and corporations, asset-backed trusts, and mortgages.\nWe do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our securities as \u201cavailable for sale,\u201d no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.\nWe do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.\nPension Obligation Risk. We provide a pension plan for a number of former employees. In applying relevant accounting policies, we have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, and health care cost trends. The cost of pension benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions, and benefit experience. In 2019, we contributed $18.0 million to our pension plan.\nThe effective discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations in 2019 ranged from 2.52% to 2.81%. The expected rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2019 was 6.00%.

The counterparties to our litigation are sometimes large, well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than us.

Acacia disputes the allegations and does not believe that Celltrace is entitled to any damages. Acacia successfully moved to compel arbitration of the dispute, and the District Court stayed the litigation pending arbitration before the International Court of Arbitration for the International Chamber of Commerce, or the ICC. Celltrace appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which denied the appeal. Celltrace filed its request for arbitration of the claims with the ICC on November 28, 2016. Acacia filed an answer denying all allegations of wrongdoing and asserting affirmative defenses.

Although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business, such litigation could result in large monetary awards, especially if compensatory and/or punitive damages are awarded. However, we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position, earnings, or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we are also involved in proceedings, investigations, and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental, health, safety, competition, and tax matters.\nThe Company is a party to proceedings under CERCLA, RCRA, and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there are 31 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the Company, along with others, has been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites. We do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position. Additional information on the Company\u2019s environmental exposure is included under Item 1, Business-Environmental Controls.\nIn September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (\"CADE\") issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $43 million at 30 September 2019) on Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice, whose investigation began in 2003, alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of the Company\u2019s total revenue in Brazil in 2003.\nWe have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 to the Brazilian courts. On 6 May 2014, our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda. was dismissed. CADE has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending. The Company, with advice of its outside legal counsel, has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that, although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2019, the Company finalized a Consent Order with the City of Santa Clara, CA (\u201cCity\u201d) to address certain alleged administrative violations at its Santa Clara facility. The Consent Order requires the Company to pay the City approximately $.6 million to settle the allegations, which includes an enforcement penalty and funding for various supplemental environmental and training projects.\nOther than the CADE matter discussed above, we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices as discussed below. We have no exposure to foreign currency risk as all of our business is conducted in U.S. Dollars and we had no amounts outstanding on variable interest debt as of December 31, 2019. We use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk. We use cash, futures and option contracts to hedge changes to the commodity prices of corn, natural gas and ethanol. We do not enter into these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe seek to minimize the risks from fluctuations in the prices of raw material inputs, such as corn and natural gas, and finished products, such as ethanol and distiller grains, through the use of hedging instruments. In practice, as markets move, we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate. Although we believe our hedge positions accomplish an economic hedge against our future purchases and sales, management has chosen not to use hedge accounting, which would match the gain or loss on our hedge positions to the specific commodity purchase being hedged. We are using fair value accounting for our hedge positions, which means as the current market price of our hedge positions changes, the realized or unrealized gains and losses are immediately recognized in our cost of goods sold or as an offset to revenues. The immediate recognition of hedging gains and losses under fair value accounting can cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had price protection in place for approximately 6% of our anticipated corn needs, 78% of our natural gas needs and 15% of our ethanol sales for the next 12 months. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate our exposure to ethanol, corn and natural gas price risk. Market risk related to these factors is estimated as the potential change in income resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the average cost of our corn and natural gas prices and average ethanol price as of December 31, 2019, net of the forward and future contracts used to hedge our market risk for corn and natural gas usage requirements. The volumes are based on our expected use and sale of these commodities for a one year period from December 31, 2019. The results of this analysis, which may differ from actual results, are as follows:\nFor comparison purposes, our sensitivity analysis for our 2018 fiscal year is set forth below.\nLiability Risk\nWe participate, along with other plants in the industry, in a group captive insurance company (Captive). The Captive insures losses related to workman's compensation, commercial property and general liability. The Captive reinsures catastrophic losses for all participants, including the Company, in excess of predetermined amounts. Our premiums are accrued by a charge to income for the period to which the premium relates and is remitted by our insurer to the captive reinsurer. These premiums are structured such that we have made a prepaid collateral deposit estimated for losses related to the above coverage. The Captive\ninsurer has estimated and collected an amount in excess of the estimated losses but less than the catastrophic loss limit insured by the Captive. We cannot be assessed over the amount in the collateral fund.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk associated with fluctuations in commodity prices that the company is exposed to.

The LIBOR margin for Term Loan A loans is 4.25%, the LIBOR margin for Term Loan B loans is 5.25%, and the LIBOR margin for revolving loans varies between 3.75% and 4.25%, depending on our total net leverage ratio. The Base Rate margin for Term Loan A loans is 3.25%, the Base Rate margin for Term Loan B loans is 4.25%, and the Base Rate margin for revolving loans varies between 2.75% and 3.25%, depending on our total net leverage ratio. Effective May 31, 2019, we maintain eight amortizing interest rate swap agreements with current notional amounts totaling $700.0 million, through which we receive a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR, and we pay a fixed rate of interest equal to approximately 2.2% plus a spread. Each of these interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges from their inception through October 18, 2020. Upon entering into the Purchase Agreement with Kainos on October 18, 2020, we determined that some of our hedged transactions would not materially occur in the initially identified time period since we expected to use the majority of the net proceeds from the sale to pay down a significant portion of outstanding debt. As a result, we concluded that five of the eight interest rate swaps no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment, and we discontinued the related hedging designation (\u201cde-designated swaps\u201d).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that a 100-basis point increase in LIBOR would have reduced our cash flow from operating activities by $2.4 million, which reflects increased payments on variable rate\ndebt outstanding under the Credit Agreement, partially offset by decreased payments related to the de-designated swaps (for which we pay a fixed interest rate of approximately 2.2% and receive a variable interest rate based on LIBOR).

In the normal course of business, the Company\u2019s earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. At November 3, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents on which interest income is earned at variable rates. At November 3, 2019, we had a long-term $115.0 million accounts receivable securitization program, which can be increased subject to credit approval from DZ Bank, to provide additional liquidity to meet our short-term financing needs.\nThe interest rates on these borrowings and financings are variable and, therefore, interest and other expense and interest income are affected by the general level of U.S. and foreign interest rates. Based upon the current levels of cash invested, notes payable to banks and utilization of the securitization program, on a short-term basis, a hypothetical 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased net interest expense by $0.2 million or a hypothetical 1-percentage-point decrease in interest rates would have decreased net interest expense by $0.2 million in fiscal 2019.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe have operations in several foreign countries and conduct business in the local currency in these countries. As a result, we have risk associated with currency fluctuations as the value of foreign currencies fluctuates against the dollar, in particular the British Pound, Euro, Canadian Dollar, Singapore Dollar and Indian Rupee. These fluctuations impact reported earnings.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates also impact the U.S. dollar amount of our net investment in foreign operations. The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the fiscal year-end balance sheet date. Income and expenses accounts are translated at an average exchange rate during the year which approximates the rates in effect at the transaction dates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The U.S. dollar strengthened relative to many foreign currencies as of November 3, 2019 compared to October 28, 2018. Consequently, stockholders\u2019 equity increased by $0.3 million as a result of the foreign currency translation as of November 3, 2019.\nBased upon the current levels of net foreign assets, a hypothetical 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to these currencies as of November 3, 2019 would result in an approximate $0.7 million positive translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders\u2019 equity. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar as compared to these currencies as of November 3, 2019 would result in an approximately $0.7 million negative translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders\u2019 equity.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe have exposure to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as follows:\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar and the value of certain of our underlying functional currencies, including our foreign subsidiaries, may affect our financial results. Fluctuations in exchange rates, for which we currently conduct our operations in multiple currencies, may positively or negatively affect revenues, gross margins, and operating expenses, all of which are presented in U.S. dollars. We attempt to offset foreign currency assets and liabilities where and when possible, but have not, as of December 31, 2019, entered into hedging arrangements. In the future, we may evaluate and decide, to the extent reasonable and practical, to enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions. If we were to enter into such hedging transactions, the market risk resulting from foreign currency fluctuations is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. We do not plan to enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe have exposure to Brexit as approximately 13% of our annual revenue and 4% of our annual net income is generated by our operations located within the UK, which adds incremental GBP/USD foreign exchange risk to our operating results. The primary Brexit risk we face is supply chain-related, specifically for our replenishment of certain inventory stock sourced from UK vendors who may manufacture such goods in their subsidiaries outside the UK and thus need to import those goods into the UK. As a result of uncertainty created by Brexit, we have increased, and may continue to increase, our inventory of such vendor-imported goods by an additional 10% - 20% to satisfy potential customer demand, which will expose us to incremental foreign exchange risk.\nAs of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 5% increase in foreign exchange rates where we conduct our business vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar would have resulted in an improvement of $8 million in annualized operating income.\nConversely, a hypothetical 5% decrease in foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease of $9 million in annualized operating income.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2019, we had variable-rate borrowings outstanding of $1.2 billion under the Credit Facility. Increases in the underlying interest rate elections we make will negatively affect interest expense, while decreases to the underlying interest rates will have a positive influence on our interest expense. We regularly review the projected borrowings under the Credit Facility and the current interest rate environment.\nIn July and August 2019, we executed interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $500 million that are designated as cash flow hedges. See Note 9 - Derivatives and Financial Instruments. Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates, however, due to our interest rate swap contracts, the effects are mitigated to an extent.\nIf market interest rates increase 1% over the next 12 months, our net interest expense, after considering the effects of our interest rate swap contracts, would increase by $7 million.\nConversely, if market interest rates decrease 1% over the next 12 months, our net interest expense, after considering the effects of our interest rate swap contracts, would decrease by $7 million.\nThe market risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations will not be entirely eliminated through our interest rate swap contracts.\nShort-term Investments\nWe limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents and short-term investments by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparties to such financial instruments. As a risk management policy, we limit credit exposure by diversifying such investments among investment grade counterparties.\nItem 8.", "summary": "The company has exposure to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign currency risk is managed by attempting to offset foreign currency assets and liabilities, and may be further mitigated by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts.

Interest rate risk is managed by variable-rate borrowings and interest rate swap contracts. A 1% increase in market interest rates would increase net interest expense by $7 million, while a 1% decrease would decrease net interest expense by $7 million. Short-term investments are limited by diversifying among investment grade counterparties."}
{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We use derivative and other financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nTo illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets, we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments. We applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value. Assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve, the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not be material.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2019, our exposure to interest rate risk is primarily on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2019, $42 million of our variable-rate debt was hedged by interest rate swap transactions. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges, with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on our variable-rate debt to fixed interest rates.\nInterest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing. If interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt, whether at maturity or otherwise, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. Conversely, lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. At December 31, 2019, a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $365 million and $401 million, respectively, and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows. Additionally, a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt investments by approximately $2 million and less than $7 million, respectively, and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not materially impact the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point change in the interest rate related to our variable-rate debt and variable-rate investments, and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance at December 31, 2019, our annual interest expense and interest income would increase by approximately $3 million and $1 million, respectively.\nMarket Risk\nWe have investments in marketable debt securities classified as held-to-maturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity. We consider a variety of factors in evaluating an other-than-temporary decline in value, such as: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value; the issuer\u2019s financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects; any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry; and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated near-term recovery in the market value, if any. At December 31, 2019, both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities was $20 million.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The company is exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates.

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates but may include foreign currency exchange risk and inflation in the future. There were no material quantitative changes in market risk exposures between the current and preceding fiscal years.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $228.3 million and $33.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which are held for working capital purposes. We do not make investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur cash equivalents and short-term investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our investments as \u201cavailable for sale,\u201d no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.\nUnder our debt agreements, we pay interest on any outstanding balances based on variable market rates. A significant increase in these market rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents or investment portfolio. Fluctuations in the value of our cash equivalents and investment portfolio caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities prior to maturity.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our subsidiaries is typically their local currency. Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Singapore Dollar. Due to the relatively small size of our international operations to date, our foreign currency exposure has been fairly limited and thus we have not instituted a hedging program. We are considering the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may in the future hedge balances and transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as we expand international operations.\nToday, our international sales contracts are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, while our international operating expenses are often denominated in local currencies. In the future, an increasing portion of our international sales contracts may be denominated in local currencies. Additionally, as we expand our international operations a larger portion of our operating expenses will be denominated in local currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may affect our results of operations when translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A is a disclosure about the market risks that the company is exposed to in the ordinary course of its business.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket Risk\nOur exposure to market risk is directly related to revenue from service and management fees earned based upon a percentage of assets on our platform. In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 97% and 93% of our total revenue, respectively, was based on the market value of assets on our platform and were recurring in nature. We expect this percentage to vary over time. A 1% decrease in the aggregate value of assets on the platform at the beginning of the period for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 would have caused our total revenue to decline by 1% and 1%, respectively, and would have caused our pre-tax income to decline by 19% and 4%, respectively, assuming we did not initiate additional expense measures in response to a market decline.\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in interest rates will impact our spread-based revenue. As of December 31, 2019, client cash assets participating in the insured cash deposit program at ATC totaled $1.9 billion. A change in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points at the beginning of the period for the year ended December 31, 2019 would result in an increase or decrease in income before income taxes of approximately $16.0 million on an annual basis (based on total client cash assets at December 31, 2018) and subject to any changes to interest credited to the end-investor). Actual impacts may vary depending on interest rate levels and the significance of change.\nAdditionally, changes to interest rates will impact the cost of our borrowing. Borrowing under both the Term Loan and the Revolver bears interest at (x) LIBOR plus a margin of 3.50%, with a step down to 3.25% or (y) the Alternate Base Rate, as defined and specified in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin of 2.50%, with a stepdown to 2.25%, in each case based on our achievement of a specified first-lien leverage ratio. Additionally, the Term Loan\u2019s margin was reduced by 0.25% following the IPO. With respect to the Revolver, a quarterly fee of 0.50% is due for the unused amounts thereunder, with a stepdown to 0.375% based on our achievement of a specified first-lien leverage ratio. If LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, our interest expense on an annualized basis would increase by approximately $1.2 million based on amounts drawn down under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2019 and assuming no draw down of the Revolver.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes. We operate in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. These risks are less direct and quantifiable than market risk, but managing them is critical, particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees or advisers, we could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation. Business continuity plans exist for critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. To mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout our organization and within various departments. These control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our employees operate within established corporate policies and limits.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThis text discusses the market, interest rate, and operational risks associated with the company.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. For purposes of specific risk analysis, the Company uses sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nThe Company\u2019s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the majority of its revenues will be settled in RMB and U.S. dollars. The Company\u2019s currency exchange rate risks come primarily from the sales of products to international customers. Most of the Company\u2019s assets are denominated in RMB except for part of cash and accounts receivable. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk as its revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB.\nThe value of the RMB fluctuates and is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions. In addition, the RMB is not readily convertible into U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions continue to take place either through the Bank of China or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rate quoted by the People\u2019s Bank of China. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar has been generally based on rates set by the People's Bank of China, which are set daily based on the previous day's interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets. On December 31, 2019 and 2018, the exchange rates of RMB against U.S. dollar were RMB1.00 to $0.1436 and RMB1.00 to $0.1454, respectively. Any significant future appreciation of the RMB is likely to decrease the Company\u2019s profits generated from overseas.\nIn order to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk, the Company and its international customers established a price negotiation mechanism that provides that, if the currency exchange rate fluctuation is more than 8% since the last price negotiation, the Company and the customers would adjust the prices for future sales. Normally the adjustment to future sales prices would reflect half of the impact from the change in exchange rate.\n44 | Page\nCREDIT RISK\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. The Company does not require collateral or other security to support client receivables since most of its customers are large, well-established companies. The Company's credit risk is also mitigated because its customers are all selected enterprises supported by the local government. One customer, Fiat Chrysler North America, accounted for more than 10% (22.7%) of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues in 2019. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for any potential credit losses related to its trade receivables. The Company does not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies and the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from its credit facility borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had nil of outstanding indebtedness, which is subject to interest rate fluctuations.\nThe Company\u2019s level of outstanding indebtedness fluctuates from time to time and may result in additional payable.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Company\u2019s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk, though it should be noted that the assets under management by Wealth Management are affected by equity price risk. The ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the Company\u2019s asset/liability management process, which is governed by policies\nestablished by its Board of Directors. The Company has established a management Asset/Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) that oversees and develops guidelines and strategies that govern the Company\u2019s asset/liability management activities, based upon estimated market risk sensitivity, policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends.\nInterest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates. As interest rates change, the interest income and expense streams associated with the Company\u2019s financial instruments also change, affecting net interest income, the primary component of the Company\u2019s earnings. ALCO uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes.\nThe simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the Company\u2019s balance sheets. The simulation model\u2019s sensitivity analysis is compared to ALCO policy limits, which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one-year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth, given upward and downward shifts in interest rates. The following reflects the range of the Company\u2019s estimated net interest income sensitivity analysis during 2019 and 2018.\nWhile these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model, management believes that the current interest rate exposure is manageable and does not indicate any significant exposure to interest rate changes.\nThe preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent the Company\u2019s forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions, including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows. While assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, the Company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change.\nAlso, as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis, actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed, the varying impact of interest rate change, caps or floors on adjustable rate assets, the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans, depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes, and other internal and external variables. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that ALCO might take in response to or anticipation of changes in interest rates.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk, which is managed and monitored by the Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO).

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nCURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\nDue to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. We use operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. The primary currencies of our derivative instruments are the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged, such as in certain emerging markets, may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nThe gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at April 26, 2019 and April 27, 2018 was $11.1 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively. At April 26, 2019, these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of $322 million. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at April 26, 2019 indicates that, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened/weakened by 10 percent against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase/decrease by approximately $916 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we began accounting for our operations in Argentina as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100 percent. The change did not have a material impact on our results for fiscal year 2019.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs. Our debt portfolio at April 26, 2019 was comprised of debt predominately denominated in U.S. dollars and the Euro, of which substantially all is fixed rate debt. We are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments, which include our marketable debt securities, fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements, and forward starting interest rate swap agreements.\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates, as compared to interest rates at April 26, 2019, indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by $49 million.\nFor a discussion of current market conditions and the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, please see the \u201cLiquidity\u201d section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis in \"Item 7.

{"section": "Item 7a.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nGeneral\nWe are exposed to worldwide market risks that may impact our Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows due primarily to changing interest and foreign exchange rates as well as volatility in commodity prices. The following discussion provides additional information regarding the market risks.\nInterest Rates\nInterest rate fluctuations expose the variable-rate debt of the organization to changes in interest expense and cash flows. At August 31, 2019, the variable-rate debt was solely comprised of our $4.0 million long-term industrial revenue bond. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of August 31, 2019. A 10% increase in market interest rates at August 31, 2019, would have resulted in a de minimis amount of additional annual after-tax interest expense. A fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to our fixed-rate debt, which includes the $350.0 million publicly-traded fixed-rate notes. A 10% increase in market interest rates at August 31, 2019 would have decreased the estimated fair value of these debt obligations by approximately $0.4 million. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for additional information.\nForeign Exchange Rates\nThe majority of our net sales, expense, and capital purchases are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuation exists due to our operations in Mexico and Canada, where a significant portion of products sold are produced or sourced from the United States, and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. Based on fiscal 2019 performance, a hypothetical decline in the value of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar of 10% would negatively impact operating profit by approximately $12 million, while a hypothetical appreciation of 10% in the value of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar would favorably impact operating profit by approximately $15 million. In addition to products and services sold in Mexico, a significant portion of the goods sold in the United States are manufactured in Mexico. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar would favorably impact operating profit by approximately $13 million, while a hypothetical increase of 10% in the value of the Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar would negatively impact operating profits by approximately $16 million. The individual impacts to the operating profit of hypothetical currency fluctuations in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso have been calculated in isolation from any potential responses to address such exchange rate changes in our foreign markets.\nOur exposure to foreign currency risk related to our operations in Europe is immaterial and has been excluded from this analysis.\nCommodity Prices\nWe utilize a variety of raw materials and components in our production processes including petroleum-based products, steel, and aluminum. In fiscal 2019, we purchased approximately 90,000 tons of steel and aluminum. We estimate that approximately 7% of raw materials purchased are petroleum-based and that approximately six million gallons of diesel fuel were consumed in fiscal 2019. Failure to effectively manage future increases in the costs of these items could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks that the organization is exposed to, including interest rate fluctuations, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. Interest rate fluctuations could affect the variable-rate debt of the organization, while foreign exchange rate fluctuations could impact operating profit in Mexico and Canada. Commodity prices, such as petroleum-based products, steel, and aluminum, could also have an adverse impact on the organization's results of operations and cash flow."}
{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nThe following discussion about Hecla's risk-management activities includes \"forward-looking statements\" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nThe following tables summarize the financial instruments and derivative instruments held by Hecla at December 31, 2000, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and commodity prices. Hecla believes that there has not been a material change in its market risk since the end of its last fiscal year. In the normal course of business, Hecla also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable (See \"Investment Considerations\" of Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K).\nInterest-Rate Risk Management\nAt December 31, 2000, Hecla's debt was subject to changes in market interest rates and was sensitive to those changes. Hecla currently has no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes. Hecla may choose to use derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes.\nThe following table presents principal cash flows for debt outstanding at December 31, 2000, by maturity date and the related average interest rate. The variable rates are estimated based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.\nCommodity-Price Risk Management\nHedging\nHecla uses commodity forward sales commitments, commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which it produces. Contract positions are designed to ensure that Hecla will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of its production. Hecla uses these instruments to reduce risk by offsetting market exposures. Hecla is exposed to certain losses, generally the amount by which the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity, in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these agreements. The instruments held by Hecla are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. All of these contracts were designated as hedges at December 31, 2000.\nThe following table provides information about Hecla's forward sales commitments and commodity swap contracts at December 31, 2000. The table presents the notional amount in ounces, the average forward sales price and the total-dollar contract amount expected by the maturity dates, which occur between January 31, 2001 and December 31, 2004.\nIn addition to the above contracts, Hecla has a quarterly Gold Lease Rate Swap at a fixed rate of 1.5% on 215,611 ounces of the above gold forward contracts. The ounces covered under the swap are adjusted each quarter, in accordance with the expiration of the gold forward contracts. The estimated cost to close out the Gold Lease Rate Swap at December 31, 2000, was $136,174.\nTrading\nOn July 30, 1999, Hecla sold call options for 300,000 ounces of silver through June 30, 2000, at an average strike price of $5.50. Hecla sold the call options to provide additional cash flow. The sale of the options are designed to provide some price protection, to the extent of the amount of the call premium received, in the event of a decline in the price of silver. These contracts also limit the maximum that Hecla may receive on a portion of Hecla's silver production to the strike price of the options plus the premium received. During 2000, Hecla recognized revenue of $66,000 from expired call option contracts. There are no call options outstanding at December 31, 2000.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: Hecla is exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and commodity prices. To manage this risk, Hecla uses financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and derivative instruments such as commodity forward sales commitments, commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts. At December 31, 2000, Hecla had debt subject to changes in market interest rates and held derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes. Hecla also had forward sales commitments and commodity swap contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which it produces. Hecla sold call options for 300,000 ounces of silver through June 30, 2000, to provide additional cash flow and price protection."}
{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nCommodity Price Risk\nAs an independent oil and gas producer, our revenue, cash flows from operations, other income and profitability, reserve values, access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of oil and gas. Declines in commodity prices will adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as global, political and economic conditions. Historically, prices received for our oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable, and such volatility is expected to continue. Most of our production is sold at market prices. Generally, if the commodity indices fall, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. Assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended December 31, 2019, a 10% decline in oil and gas prices would have reduced our operating revenue and cash flows by approximately $12.9 million for the year. If commodity prices remain at their current levels the impact on operating revenues and cash flows, could be much more significant. However, we do have derivative contracts in place that will mitigate the impact of low commodity prices.\nIf oil prices decline by $25.00 per Bbl from the prices used in the December 31, 2019 reserve report, the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved producing reserves of December 31, 2019 would decline by $115.5 million, or 56.4%, and our proved undeveloped reserves would become uneconomical to develop.\nDerivative Instrument Sensitivity\nAt December 31, 2019, the aggregate fair market value of our commodity derivative contracts was a liability of approximately $7.4 million. The fair market value of our commodity derivative contracts is sensitive to changes in the market price for oil and gas. When our derivative contract prices are higher than prevailing market prices, we recognize gains and conversely, when our derivative contract prices are lower than prevailing market prices, we incur losses.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our First Lien Credit Facility and our Second Lien Credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, we had $95.8 million of outstanding indebtedness under our First Lien Credit Facility and $100.0 of outstanding indebtedness under our Second Lien Credit Facility, each with a variable interest rate. At December 31, 2019, the interest rate on the First Lien Credit Facility was approximately 4.8% based on 1-month LIBOR borrowings and level of utilization. An increase in the interest rate of 1% would increase our interest expense by $1.0 million on an annual basis, based on the outstanding balance at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the interest rate on the Second Lien Credit Facility was approximately 10.9% based on 3-month LIBOR borrowings. An increase of 1% would increase our interest expense by $1.0 million on an annual basis, based on the outstanding balance at December 31, 2019.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

Primarily through our wholly owned subsidiary, Anchor Group Management, Inc. (\u201cAGMI\u201d), our objective is recapturing and maintaining business we have historically written in the taxi, livery/limo and paratransit sectors as well as generating new business that fits our current underwriting parameters. We are also actively pursuing additional programs in the \u201clight\u201d commercial auto space where we believe our expertise, infrastructure and insurance technology will enable us to increase scale and profitability, but there can be no assurance that these programs will materialize. Our team believes that the specialized infrastructure and technology platforms we\u2019ve developed over the years to support our traditional business will enable us to provide comparative advantages as a managing general agency in other commercial auto segments. In particular, our ability to efficiently manage large numbers of small or highly transactional accounts through our technology platform and workflows is a differentiator. We are also evaluating opportunities to leverage our optOnTM insuretech platform, which was developed to provide micro-duration commercial automobile insurance for gig-economy drivers via a proprietary mobile app based ecosystem.\nOur target markets include the expanding segment of commercially licensed drivers operating through traditional public automobile sectors such as limousine, livery, non-emergency paratransit and taxi operators as well as gig-economy focused drivers who are engaged through transportation network companies (\u201cTNCs\u201d). We focus predominantly on owner-operators, small fleets, and other sub-categories of our target market that we believe are often underserved.\nIn 2019, the Company implemented a change in strategy which emphasizes the managing agency operations it owns with the objective of establishing business relationships with other unrelated insurance carriers. As part of this strategic transition, the Company expects to deploy its experience, technology and expertise in the niche segment in which Atlas traditionally focused, but de-emphasize its reliance on wholly owned insurers and rely more on external risk-taking partners. We believe that this approach will reduce certain significant risks and capital requirements related to traditional primary insurance company operations (see Item 1A.", "summary": "Risk Factors).\n\nAtlas Financial Holdings, Inc. is a business that specializes in generating, underwriting and servicing commercial automobile insurance in the United States.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, primarily arising from the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our investment portfolio. Interest rate fluctuation may arise from changes in the market\u2019s view of the quality of the security issuer, the overall economic outlook, and the time to maturity of our portfolio. We mitigate this risk by investing only in high quality, highly liquid instruments. Securities with original maturities of one year or less must be rated by two of the three industry standard rating agencies as follows: A1 by Standard & Poor\u2019s, P1 by Moody\u2019s and/or by Fitch. Securities with original maturities of greater than one year must be rated by two of the following industry standard rating agencies as follows: AA- by Standard & Poor\u2019s, Aa3 by Moody\u2019s and/or AA- by Fitch. By corporate investment policy, we limit the amount of exposure to $15.0 million or 10% of the portfolio, whichever is lower, for any single non-U.S. Government issuer. A single U.S. Agency can represent up to 25% of the portfolio. No more than 20% of the total portfolio may be invested in the securities of an industry sector, with money market fund investments evaluated separately. Our policy requires that at least 10% of the portfolio be in securities with a maturity of 90 days or less. We may make investments in U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Agencies, corporate bonds and municipal bonds and notes with maturities up to 36 months. However, the bias of our investment portfolio is shorter maturities. All investments must be U.S. dollar denominated. Additionally, we have no significant exposure to European sovereign debt.\nWe invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of U.S. dollar financial instruments such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Government Agencies, commercial paper and corporate notes. Our policy specifically prohibits trading securities for the sole purposes of realizing trading profits. However, we may liquidate a portion of our portfolio if we experience unforeseen liquidity requirements. In such a case, if the environment has been one of rising interest rates we may experience a realized loss, similarly, if the environment has been one of declining interest rates we may experience a realized gain. As of December 31, 2019, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income marketable securities of $363.5 million including cash equivalents. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 1.0% from the levels as of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately $0.5 million. Actual results may differ materially from this sensitivity analysis.\nThe fair value of our convertible notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. The fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines in value. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our convertible notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation.\nWe invoice the majority of our customers in U.S. dollars. Although the fluctuation of currency exchange rates may impact our customers, and thus indirectly impact us, we do not attempt to hedge this indirect and speculative risk. Our overseas operations consist primarily of international business operations in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, design centers in Canada, India and Finland and small business development offices in Australia, China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.

Legal Proceedings.\nReference is made to the discussion above under \"Environmental Matters\" in Item 1 for information as to various environmental investigation and remediation obligations of the Company's subsidiaries associated principally with their recycling and production facilities and to certain legal proceedings associated with such facilities.\nIn addition to such matters, the Company or certain of its subsidiaries is subject to certain litigation described below.\nOn or about April 17, 1997, CP and the Company were served with a complaint filed by Chevron USA, Inc. (\"Chevron\") in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that operations of CP at its Sewaren plant affected adjoining property owned by Chevron and that Philipp Brothers, as the parent of CP, is also responsible to Chevron. The complaint includes statutory claims under RCRA and common law claims. There are several other defendants in the action, including the former owner of the Sewaren site and Chevron's site and a prior tenant of the Chevron site. Additional parties have been brought into the action. Interrogatories have been exchanged and depositions are being conducted. The Company is not, at this time, in a position to assess the extent of any ultimate liability it may have in connection with this suit or the potential responsibility of other defendants, or the future cost of remediation of the Chevron site, and is actively defending the action.\nThe Company's Phibro-Tech subsidiary was named in 1993 as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") in connection with an action commenced under CERCLA by the EPA, involving a former third party fertilizer manufacturing site in Jericho, South Carolina. Phibro-Tech responded that it had supplied a useful product to the operator of the site and that it believes this constitutes a defense to the claims brought against it. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, which had assumed oversight of this site, filed suit in United States District Court to approve a settlement with certain steel company PRPs. Other parties intervened and filed administrative actions to contest the substantive and procedural fairness of that settlement. The Court permitted other PRPs to intervene and, in August 1999, disapproved the settlement. Discussions between representatives of the original group of settling PRPs and of the other PRPs have taken place in an effort to determine whether a joint settlement proposal is feasible. Under applicable law all non-settling PRPs could be found to have strict, joint and several liability under CERCLA. Accordingly, Phibro-Tech will continue to assess how best to respond to claims raised in this proceeding. While the outcome of ongoing negotiations is uncertain, the Company has accrued its best estimate of the amount for which this matter can be settled.\nIn February, 2000, the EPA notified numerous parties of potential liability for waste disposed of at a licensed Casmalia, California disposal site, including a business, assets of which were originally acquired by a subsidiary of the Company in 1984. Phibro-Tech has responded, requested further information and joined a PRP working group which has engaged in discussions with the EPA. The Company is not, at this time, in a position to assess the extent of any ultimate liability it may have in connection with this proceeding or the potential responsibility of other PRPs.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business including product liabilities and governmental regulation. Certain of these actions seek damages in various amounts. In most cases, such claims are covered by insurance. The Company believes that none of the claims or pending lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nItem 4.", "summary": "The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various environmental investigation and remediation obligations, as well as legal proceedings associated with their recycling and production facilities.

In June 2015, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the \u201cCorps\u201d) jointly issued a final rule that proposed to clarify, but may actually expand, the scope of waters regulated under the federal Clean Water Act. The final rule (the \u201c2015 Clean Water Rule\u201d) became effective in August 2015, but has been challenged through numerous lawsuits. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order staying the effectiveness of the final rule nationwide pending adjudication of substantive challenges to the rule. In early 2017, the U.S. President issued an Executive Order directing EPA and the Corps to publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the new rule. In June 2017, EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rule that would rescind the 2015 Clean Water Rule and re-codify regulatory text that existed prior to enactment of the 2015 Clean Water Rule. In November 2017, EPA issued a rule notice proposing to extend the applicability date of the 2015 Clean Water Rule for two years from the date of final action on the proposed rule, to provide continuity and regulatory certainty while agencies proceed to consider potential changes to the 2015 Clean Water Rule.\nIn January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held all challenges to the 2015 Clean Water Rule must be heard in federal district courts rather than in the federal courts of appeal, overruling a decision by the Sixth Circuit's Court of Appeals. With the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals no longer having jurisdiction, that court lifted its 2015 nationwide stay in February 2018. After the nationwide stay was lifted, a number of U.S. District Courts revived dormant litigation that challenged the 2015 Clean Water Rule. In June 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered an injunction against implementation of the 2015 Clean Water Rule covering 11 states, including Florida. As of September 2018, federal district courts have put the 2015 Clean Water Rule on hold in 28 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories.\nOn December 11, 2018, EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rule to replace the 2015 Clean Water Rule. The agencies\u2019 stated interpretation for the proposed rule is to provide clarity, predictability and consistency so that the regulated community can better understand where the Clean Water Act applies and where it does not.\nOn September 12, 2019, EPA and the Corps jointly issued a final regulation that repeals the 2015 Clean Water Rule and restores the previous regulatory regime. This regulation reestablishes national consistency by returning all jurisdictions to the longstanding regulatory framework that existed prior to the 2015 Clean Water Rule. The final rule takes effect sixty (60) days after publication in the Federal Register. A challenge to this legislation is possible.\nRepeal of the 2015 Clean Water Rule was the first step in a two-step rulemaking process to define the scope of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d that are regulated under the Clean Water Act.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk for our restaurants operating in the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Mexico and the Middle East. If foreign currency exchange rates depreciate in these countries or regions, or any other country or region in which we may operate in the future, we may experience declines in our international operating results but such exposure would not be material to the consolidated financial statements. We currently do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate changes.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to market price fluctuations in beef, seafood, produce and other food product prices. Given the historical volatility of beef, seafood, produce and other food product prices, these fluctuations can materially impact our food and beverage costs. While we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers who meet our standards as suppliers for our restaurants and enter into agreements with suppliers for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations, we do not enter into long-term agreements for the purchase of such supplies. There can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control and we may be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Because we typically set our menu prices in advance of our food product prices, our menu prices cannot immediately take into account the changing costs of food items. To the extent that we are unable to pass the increased costs on to our customers through price increases, our results of operations would be adversely affected. We do not use financial instruments to hedge our risk to market price fluctuations in beef, seafood, produce and other food product prices at this time.\nInflation\nOver the past several years, inflation has not significantly affected our operations. However, the impact of inflation on labor, food and occupancy costs could, in the future, significantly affect our operations. We pay many of our employees hourly rates related to the applicable federal or state minimum wage. Food costs as a percentage of revenues have been somewhat stable due to procurement efficiencies and menu price adjustments, although no assurance can be made that our procurement will continue to be efficient or that we will be able to raise menu prices in the future. Costs for construction, taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance all impact our occupancy costs. We believe that our current strategy, which is to seek to maintain operating margins through a combination of menu price increases, cost controls, careful evaluation of property and equipment needs, and efficient purchasing practices, has been an effective tool for dealing with inflation. There can be no assurance, however, that future inflationary or other cost pressure will be effectively offset by this strategy.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThis text discusses the market risks faced by a company operating in multiple countries.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from market changes) to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates, price risk and project cancellation risk.\nThe assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate, price risk and project cancellation risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods, our current knowledge of the marketplace, and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate.\nForeign Currency\nInternational consolidated sales for fiscal 2019 were 35% of total sales, up from 33% of sales in fiscal 2018. Operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates. Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies. Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified. In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. In fiscal 2019, substantially all sales for which we or our subsidiaries were paid were denominated in the local currency (U.S. dollars or Chinese RMB).\nWe have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases. In fiscal 2019, our purchases in foreign currencies represented 2% of the cost of products sold. At certain times, we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales and purchase contracts negotiated in foreign currencies. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not used in fiscal 2019 and as of March 31, 2019, we held no forward foreign currency contracts.\nPrice Risk\nOperating in a global marketplace requires us to compete with other global manufacturers which, in some instances, benefit from lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions. Although we believe that our customers differentiate our products on the basis of our manufacturing quality and engineering experience and excellence, among other things, such lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions mean that certain of our competitors are able to offer products similar to ours at lower prices. In extreme market downturns, such as we recently experienced, we typically see depressed price levels. Moreover, the cost of metals and other materials used in our products have experienced significant volatility. Such factors, in addition to the global effects of the recent volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, have resulted in downward demand and pricing pressure on our products.\nProject Cancellation and Project Continuation Risk\nAdverse economic or specific project conditions can lead to a project being placed on hold or cancelled by our customers. In fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, we had no projects cancelled. At March 31, 2019, we had no projects on hold. We attempt to mitigate the risk of cancellation by structuring contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred. As a result, we do not believe we have a significant cash exposure to projects which may be cancelled.\nOpen orders are reviewed continuously through communications with customers. If it becomes evident to us that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date, management will move the project into \"placed on hold\" (i.e., suspended) category. Furthermore, if a project is cancelled by our customer, it is removed from our backlog.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A is a disclosure of the market risks to which the company is exposed, including foreign currency exchange rates, price risk, and project cancellation risk. The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to international consolidated sales making up 35% of total sales in fiscal 2019, and price risk due to competition from global manufacturers with lower production costs. The company attempts to mitigate project cancellation risk by structuring contracts with customers to cover costs incurred."}
{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn October 15, 1999, Methode Electronics, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Infineon Technologies Corporation and us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking unspecified damages, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs arising from our alleged infringement of some claims contained in Methode's U.S. Patents Nos. 5,528,408, 5,717,533, 5,734,558, 5,864,468 and 5,879,173. The '408 and '468 patents are alleged to relate to technology incorporated in our 1x9 pin configuration products, such as our singlemode SONET/SDH transceivers products. These products combine fiber optic transmitters and receivers in one module that conforms to the internationally agreed SONET/SDH telecommunications standard protocol. The '533, '558 and '173 patents are alleged to relate to the technology incorporated in our gigabit interface converter, or GBIC, products, such as our Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel products. Our GBICs products are a type of transceiver.\nOn December 17, 1999, we filed an answer to Methode's complaint denying Methode's claims of infringement and asserting a number of defenses, including noninfringement and invalidity of the Methode patents. On June 27, 2000, Methode filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint to add Stratos Lightwave Inc., a Methode spin-off and assignee of the patents-in-suit, as an additional plaintiff and to allege that we infringe U.S. Reissue Patent No. 36,820 (a reissue of U.S. Patent No. 5,546,281) through certain aspects of our GBIC products. Methode has since withdrawn its motion to amend with respect to the RE '820 Patent. Methode may later seek to amend its complaint again to allege infringement of the claims of the RE '820 Patent, or may later file a separate proceeding against the Company alleging infringement of the reissued patent's claims. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, sales of our 1x9 pin configuration products alleged to infringe the '408 and '468 patents accounted for 38.8% of our total revenue. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, sales of our GBIC products alleged to infringe the '533, '558, '173 and '820 patents represented an immaterial amount of our total revenue.\nThis lawsuit is in the early stages. No formal discovery has been conducted, and a portion of the case relating to the claims involving the '408 and '468 patents relating to our 1x9 pin configuration products have been stayed pending the completion of the Patent and Trademark Office's re-examination of the '408 patent. In the re-examination, the Patent and Trademark Office has been requested to reexamine the claims of this patent in view of prior art that was not considered by the Patent Office prior to the patent's issuance.\nWe intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this lawsuit. However, the outcome of this lawsuit is uncertain. Our defense of this lawsuit, regardless of its eventual outcome, will likely be costly and time consuming. We expect to incur greater legal fees and expenses in connection with this lawsuit. If Methode's patents are found to be valid and enforceable and our products are found to infringe, we may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling some of our products, we may be liable for significant monetary damages, and we may have to obtain a license from Methode in order to use its patented technology, any of which could harm our business. If we are required to obtain a license to any of Methode's patents, such license may not be available from Methode on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. See \"Business - Risk Factors - If we are unsuccessful in defending against Methode's lawsuit for patent infringement, we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to Methode and may be enjoined from manufacturing and selling some of our products.\"\nWe are not currently involved in any other material legal proceedings, nor have we been involved in any such proceedings that has had or may have a significant effect on our company.

Based upon the new facts, the Company filed a motion to amend the complaint to add new claims and the related entity as a party. On September 1, 2020, the court ruled in favor of the Company and permitted the Company to amend the complaint to add the related entity. On September 1, 2020, the Company filed an amended complaint naming the related entity a party and added intentional misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, civil conspiracy, aiding and abetting, successor liability and fraudulent concealment claims.

On August 28, 2018, VVG filed an Answer and Counterclaim against the Company. On August 2, 2019, a jury found in favor of the Company and awarded the Company damages totaling $2,773,321. In March 2020, VVG filed its opening appeal brief. The Company\u2019s response brief was due on May 15, 2020. After VVG filed its opening brief in March 2020, the Company filed a Motion to Strike portions of the brief and record. Because a successful ruling on the Company\u2019s motion may strike portions of VVG\u2019s brief or require VVG to refile it, the Company asked the court for an extension of the deadline to file the Company\u2019s answering brief until the court renders its decision on the motion, which VVG did not oppose. The Company will have 30 days to file its answering brief once the court enters an order on the Motion to Strike or 30 days from when VVG files an amended opening brief and record. On August 27, 2020, the court ordered VVG to supplement its brief and the record. The Company filed its answering brief on October 15, 2020. On October 27, 2020, the Company, in a joint request with VVG, filed a motion to extend its time to file its answering brief. The Company filed its answering brief in January 2021. VVG\u2019s reply brief is due on or before February 4, 2021.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nCommodity Risk. Our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production. Realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas. This commodity pricing volatility has continued with unpredictable price swings in recent periods.\nOur price-risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments (such as futures, forward contracts, swaps and options contracts) to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. We do not utilize these agreements and financial instruments for trading and only enter into derivative agreements with banks in our Credit Facility. For additional discussion related to our price-risk management policy, refer to Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nCustomer Credit Risk. We are exposed to the risk of financial non-performance by customers. Our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base. Continued volatility in both credit and commodity markets may reduce the liquidity of our customer base. To manage customer credit risk, we monitor credit ratings of customers and from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit, parent company guarantees if applicable, and other collateral as considered necessary to reduce risk of loss. Due to availability of other purchasers, we do not believe the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nConcentration of Sales Risk. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 19%, 17%, 17% and 13% of our oil and gas receipts were accounted for by Kinder Morgan, Inc. (\u201cKinder Morgan\u201d), Plains Marketing, LP (\u201cPlains Marketing\u201d), Twin Eagle Resource Management LLC (\u201cTwin Eagle\u201d) and Trafigura US, Inc (\u201cTrafigura\u201d). There were no other purchasers who individually accounted for 10% or more of our oil and gas receipts. We expect to continue these relationships in the future. We believe that the risk of these unsecured receivables is mitigated by the size, reputation and nature of the businesses and the availability of other purchasers in the areas where we operate.\nInterest Rate Risk. At December 31, 2020, we had a combined $430.0 million drawn under our Credit Facility and our Second Lien Notes, which bear a floating rate of interest depending on the level of the borrowing base and the borrowing base loans outstanding and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. These variable interest rate borrowings are impacted by changes in short-term interest rates.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is exposed to certain market risks inherent in the Company's financial instruments that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. The Company is subject to variable interest rate risk on its existing Senior Credit Facility and any future financing requirements. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nIn connection with the provisions of its Senior Credit Facility and the Company's overall interest rate management objectives, the Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks from significant increases in interest rates. The Company's strategy is to purchase interest rate swaps, collars and caps from large financial institutions to limit the impact of increases in interest rates on the Company's variable rate long-term debt.\nAs of December 31, 2000, the Company has an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of $15 million that terminates in September 2001. The interest rate cap agreement requires premium payments to the counterparty based on the notional amount of the contracts that are capitalized and amortized to interest expense over the life of the contract. This agreement entitles the Company to receive quarterly payments from the counterparties for amounts, if any, by which the U.S. three month LIBOR rate exceeds 7%. In addition, the Company entered into an interest rate collar agreement with a large financial institution that terminates in February 2002. The notional amount of the interest rate collar is $25 million and the agreement has a cap rate of 6.5% and a floor rate of 4.8% based on the U.S. one month LIBOR rate.\nAs of December 31, 2000, the Company has an interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of $7.5 million with a termination date of June 2001. The interest rate swap requires the Company to pay fixed rates of 6.4% in exchange for variable rate payments based on the U.S. three month LIBOR (5.1% as of December 31, 2000). Interest rate differentials are paid or received every three months and are recognized as adjustments to interest expense.\nBased upon the Company's variable rate indebtedness and weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2000, a ten percent (or one thousand basis points) increase in market interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $24.7 million. A ten percent (or one thousand basis points) decrease in market interest rates would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $23.4 million.\nThese amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates and equity prices on the Company's financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Company's financial arrangements or capital structure.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe Company is exposed to certain market risks inherent in its financial instruments, such as variable interest rate risk on its existing Senior Credit Facility and any future financing requirements.

At December 31, 2000, our foreign currency translation adjustment was not material and, for the year ended December 31, 2000, net foreign currency transaction losses were insignificant. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and related expenses, changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors' products become more or less attractive.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2000, approximately 41% of our revenues and 33% of our operating expenses were denominated in British pounds. Historically, the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates has not had a material impact on our operations. Our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will increase as we expand our international operations. We conduct our European operations in the United Kingdom and the countries of the European Union which are part of the European Monetary Union. There is a single currency within certain countries of the European Union, known as the euro, and one organization, the European Central Bank is responsible for setting European monetary policy. We have reviewed the impact the euro has on our business and whether this will give rise to a need for significant changes in our commercial operations or treasury management functions. Because our European transactions are primarily denominated in British pounds and as yet we have not experienced any significant impact on our European operations from the fluctuations in the exchange rate between euro and British pounds, we do not believe that the euro conversion will have any material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risk associated with the company's investments and foreign currency transactions.

{"section": "Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nForeign Currency\nWe have international operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada, Czech Republic and Mexico, which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar, Czech Krona and Mexican pesos, respectively. We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk and we take action from time to time in order to best mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $12,700 on our 2019 sales. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to partially offsetting impacts on cost of sales and operating expenses in those currencies. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales in 2019 compared to 2018 by approximately $7,800.\nWe translate all assets and liabilities of foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income. The translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $680 for 2019 and a loss of $3,109 for 2018. Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in total other expense, net amounted to a loss of $111 and a gain of $169 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $7,000 and $6,000 on our foreign net assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nInterest Rates\nOn February 12, 2020, the Company entered into the Amended Credit Agreement for the $225 million Amended Revolving Facility. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Amended Credit Agreement. Amounts below represent payments due based on the Prior Credit Agreement at December 31, 2019.\nInterest rates on our Prior Credit Agreement are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.75%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.75%), in each case depending on the Company\u2019s ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA. We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $110,085 outstanding under the Revolving Facility (excluding deferred financing fees), of which $40,000 is currently being hedged. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding debt. A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $70,085 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 would have an impact of approximately $701 on our interest expense for 2019. A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the average unhedged floating rate debt outstanding during 2018 would not have a material impact on our interest expense for 2018.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: The company has international operations in multiple countries, which exposes them to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2019, a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to their most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $12,700 on their sales.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe currently own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations, including our research and development activities. None of these market-risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. Our investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments. These bonds are subject to interest rate risk, and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate. Due to the conservative nature of these instruments, we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk. We do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.\nThe following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or \"other than trading\" instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk, whether interest rate, foreign currency exchange, commodity price or equity price risk. We have not purchased options or entered into swaps, forward or futures contracts. Our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk on borrowings under our credit facility, which are subject to interest rates based on the bank's base rate. We also have an outstanding promissory note issued in favor of Xenova Discovery Limited at the LIBOR rate plus one percent and a change in the applicable interest rate on these loans would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds. The aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those borrowings held by us at December 31, 2000, which are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates is approximately $38,177 after tax. The hypothetical loss was determined by financial instruments held by us at December 31, 2000. Fixed rate financial instruments were not evaluated.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nWe face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies. The functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. Based on our overall currency rate exposure at December 31, 2000, A 10% change in foreign exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To date, we have not hedged the risks associated with foreign exchange exposure. Although we may do so in the future, we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques we may implement will be successful or that our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks associated with the company's investment portfolio.

PRPs include parties identified through manifest records as having contributed to deliveries of hazardous substances to the Philip Services Site between 1979 and 1999. The DHEC\u2019s allegation that the Company was a PRP arises out of four manifest entries in 1989 under the name of a company unaffiliated with Wabash National (or any of its former or current subsidiaries) that purport to be delivering a de minimis amount of hazardous waste to the Philip Services Site \u201cc/o Wabash National Corporation.\u201d As such, the Philip Services Site PRP Group (the \u201cPRP Group\u201d) notified Wabash in August 2014 that it was offering the Company the opportunity to resolve any liabilities associated with the Philip Services Site by entering into a Cash Out and Reopener Settlement Agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) with the PRP Group, as well as a Consent Decree with the DHEC. The Company has accepted the offer from the PRP Group to enter into the Settlement Agreement and Consent Decree, while reserving its rights to contest its liability for any deliveries of hazardous materials to the Philips Services Site. The requested settlement payment is immaterial to the Company\u2019s financial conditions or operations, and as a result, if the Settlement Agreement and Consent Decree are finalized, the payment to be made by the Company thereunder is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nOn November 13, 2019, the Company received a notice as a PRP by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management related to substances found at a property located at 817 South Earl Avenue, Lafayette, Indiana (\u201cthe Site\u201d).

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, inflation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur primary exposure to market risk relates to interest rate changes. We had cash and cash equivalents of $184.4 million and no marketable securities as of December 31, 2019, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of interest bearing checking accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. Marketable securities consist of U.S. treasury securities not otherwise classified as cash equivalents.\nSuch interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates.\nOur debt is comprised of a revolving line of credit account, which had no amount outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at the highest of (i) the bank\u2019s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent, and (iii) the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 1.00 percent. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur customers consume our services primarily in the United States. Our revenue and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result we have minimal foreign currency risk as of December 31, 2019.\nThe local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the Euro and the British Pound. Our subsidiaries remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange rates, while non-monetary items are remeasured at historical rates. Revenue and expense accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate in effect during the year. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the conversion of our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements into U.S. dollars would result in a realized gain or loss which is recorded in other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We do not currently engage in any hedging activity to reduce our potential exposure to currency fluctuations, although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nInflation\nWe do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

On October 21, 2013, the EPA, Region 6, issued an Inspection Report pursuant to the Clean Air Act\u2019s Risk Management Program following its inspection of the facility on June 24 through June 28, 2013. The report notes the EPA\u2019s preliminary determinations about the facility\u2019s documentation regarding process safety, process hazard analysis, as well as operating procedures, employee training, and other matters. On June 16, 2014, we received a request for information related to the Geismar Incident from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act to which we responded on August 13, 2014. We have worked with the agency to resolve these matters and in the second half of 2019, entered into a Stipulation of Settlement, which includes a penalty of $750,000 that will be due within thirty days of the Court\u2019s entry of the settlement. The Court set a fairness hearing on the settlement for December 11, 2019. Prior to the scheduled hearing, the Court continued the hearing without setting a new date.\nOn May 5, 2017, we entered into a Consent Order with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (GADNR) pertaining to alleged violations of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act and associated rules arising from a permit issued by GADNR for construction of Transco\u2019s Dalton expansion project.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We enter into derivative contracts, including contracts to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate exposures. Forward swap contracts are entered into for periods consistent with underlying exposure and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. Derivative financial instruments are used as risk management tools and not for speculative trading purposes. In addition, derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage exposure to potential nonperformance on such instruments. Developments in the capital markets are regularly monitored.\nWe are subject to interest rate market risk in connection with our Amended ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, our Amended ABL Credit Facility provided variable rate borrowings consisting of a $90.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility. The ABL facility includes a $20.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $15.0 million sub-limit for swing loans, net of $5.4 million of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2020. The Amended ABL Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or a base rate plus an applicable margin. An assumed 25 basis point change in interest rates would change interest expense on our Amended ABL Credit Facility by $0.2 million if fully drawn and outstanding for the entire year.\nWe are subject to additional interest rate market risk in connection with the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility provides us with a secured term loan credit facility of $70.0 million. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR for a three-month interest period. An assumed 25 basis point change in interest rates would change interest expense on the Term Loan Facility by $0.2 million for an entire year.\nCounterparty Risk\nWe only enter into derivative transactions with established counterparties having a credit rating of BBB or better. Counterparty credit default swap levels and credit ratings are monitored on a regular basis in an effort to reduce the risk of counterparty default. All of our derivative transactions with counterparties are governed by master ISDAs with netting arrangements. These agreements can limit our exposure in situations where we have gain and loss positions outstanding with a single counterparty. We neither post nor receive cash collateral with any counterparty for our derivative transactions. These ISDAs do not have credit contingent features; however, a default under our Amended ABL Credit Facility would trigger a default under these agreements.\nExchange Rate Sensitivity\nWe manufacture and sell our products in a number of countries and, as a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To a large extent, our global manufacturing and sales provide a natural hedge of foreign currency exchange rate movement, as foreign currency expenses generally offset foreign currency revenues. AFI enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce its remaining exposure. As of December 31, 2020, our major foreign currency exposures are to the Canadian Dollar, the Chinese Renminbi and the Australian Dollar. A 10% strengthening (or weakening) of all currencies against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2020 levels would decrease (or increase) our forecasted 2021 earnings before income taxes by approximately $0.1 million, including the impact of current foreign currency forward exchange contracts.\nThe table below details our outstanding currency instruments as of December 31, 2020:\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar when consolidating our foreign entities.

{"section": "Item 3.\nLegal Proceedings\nHollie Drive Litigation\nIn November 2019, we received notice that the Company and the Buyer were defendants in a pending case in the Circuit Court for Henry County, Virginia. The case, which had been instituted on September 18, 2019 by Hollie Drive Associates, LLC (\u201cHollie\u201d), raises issues arising from the purported breach of a lease for warehouse space in Henry County, Virginia, which is owned by Hollie and was previously rented by the Company. The relevant lease was assigned to the Buyer in connection with the Asset Sale. The complaint asserts that the Buyer breached various provisions of the lease including failure to make certain rental payments and failure to pay for certain clean-up and reconstruction after the Buyer vacated the property. The complaint seeks damages in the amount of approximately $555,000 and attorney\u2019s fees. Hollie named the Company as a party because the Company was the original tenant under the lease. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer agreed to assume and indemnify the Company against post-closing liabilities arising under the lease including those asserted in the complaint. The Buyer\u2019s filings in the case do not dispute the obligation to indemnify the Company for any damages awarded in the case. Based upon discussions with the Buyer and documents produced to date by Hollie, it appears Hollie has asserted damages greatly exceeding the likely recovery in the case. Given the relatively low damages amount and the Buyer\u2019s indemnity obligation, the Company believes it is unlikely the case will result in a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nGraham County Property Litigation\nAs previously disclosed, the Company received a letter from counsel for Graham County (the \u201cCounty\u201d), North Carolina asserting certain claims against the Company arising out of a conveyance to the County of approximately 36 acres (the \u201cProperty\u201d) in November 2014. The letter asserted that (i) the Company\u2019s failure to disclose the presence of environmental contamination on the Property constituted a breach of contract and (ii) the indemnity agreements entered into in connection with the conveyance were void. On November 26, 2019, the County filed a complaint against the Company and the Buyer in the Superior Court for Graham County, North Carolina seeking, among other things, (i) rescission of the conveyance of the Property to the County, (ii) reimbursement of expenses incurred by the County in connection with the Property, (iii) to invalidate the indemnity agreements entered into in connection with the conveyance, (iv) and other damages, or (iv), in the alternative to rescinding the conveyance, expenses necessary to make the Property suitable and useable for a public park and outdoor recreation area. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer agreed to assume and indemnify the Company against certain pre-closing liabilities including those relating to the conveyance of the Property. After the filing of the complaint, the Company entered into an agreement with the Buyer providing that, if the Company reaches a settlement with the County resulting in transfer of the Property back to the Company, then the Company can retain the Property notwithstanding provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement and will waive any right to indemnification from the Buyer with respect to the claims by the County with respect to the Property. Based upon the discussions with the County related to the amount of expenses incurred by the County, the Company does not believe the claims asserted by the County will result in a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nItem 4.", "summary": "Hollie Drive Litigation and Graham County Property Litigation are two legal proceedings that the Company and the Buyer are defendants in.

Cal.)\nOn September 22, 2009, Netlist filed suit in the United States District Court, Central District of California (Court) asserting that we infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,532,537. Netlist filed an amended complaint on December 22, 2009, further asserting that we infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,619,912 and 7,636,274, collectively with U.S. Patent No. 7,532,537, the patents-in-suit, and seeking both unspecified monetary damages to be determined and an injunction to prevent further infringement. These infringement claims allege that the iMB\u2122 and certain other memory module components infringe the patents-in-suit. We answered the amended complaint on February 11, 2010 and asserted we do not infringe the patents-in-suit and that the patents-in-suit are invalid. In 2010, we filed inter partes requests for reexamination with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), asserting that the patents-in-suit are invalid. As a result of the proceedings at the USPTO, the Court has stayed the litigation, with the parties advising the Court on status every 120 days.\nAs to the proceeding at the USPTO, reexamination has been ordered for all of the patents that were alleged to infringe. At present, the USPTO has determined that almost all of the originally filed claims are not valid, and determined certain amended claims to be patentable. The Reexamination Certificate for U.S. Patent No. 7,532,537 was issued on August 2, 2016 based upon amended claims. The Reexamination Certificate for U.S. Patent No. 7,636,274 was issued on November 5, 2018, indicating all claims 1-97 were cancelled. The parties continue to assert their respective positions with respect to the reexamination proceeding for U.S. Patent No. 7,619,912.\nWhile we intend to defend the foregoing USPTO proceedings and lawsuit vigorously, the USPTO proceedings and litigation, whether or not determined in our favor or settled, could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nBased on the nature of USPTO proceedings and litigation, we are currently unable to predict the final outcome of this lawsuit and therefore, cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss. However, because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation, should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nClaims Against eSilicon\nWe and eSilicon have received written communications from certain former stockholders of eSilicon demanding to inspect eSilicon\u2019s books and records and indicating that such stockholders will be seeking appraisal of shares they held in eSilicon. Certain of these former eSilicon stockholders also have stated that they may assert claims against eSilicon\u2019s directors and senior officers for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations in connection with the merger between eSilicon and our subsidiary. We are unaware of any petition for appraisal and/or lawsuit being filed by any former eSilicon stockholder. We believe that the claims in such written communications are without merit, and plan to vigorously defend against lawsuits arising out of or relating to the merger agreement and/or the merger that may be filed in the future.\nOther Litigation Matters\nWe are not currently a party to any other material litigation. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, including claims regarding patent and other intellectual property rights as well as improper hiring practices. We may from time to time become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from our ordinary course of business. These claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nItem 4.", "summary": "Inphi Corporation is currently a party to a legal proceeding with Netlist, Inc. in which Netlist is alleging that Inphi infringes on three U.S. patents.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to certain market risks. These risks, which include interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk, arise in the normal course of business rather than from trading activities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur cash flow exposure due to changes in interest rates related to our debt is limited as our note obligations have fixed interest rates. The fair value of our note obligations may increase or decrease for various reasons, including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions. A decline in interest rates in the future will not generally benefit us with respect to our fixed rate debt due to the terms and conditions of the indentures relating to that debt that would require us to repurchase the debt at specified premiums if redeemed early. Our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. However, based upon the nature and current level of our investments, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, we believe that there is no material interest rate exposure related to our investments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur operations outside of the United States and our 2024 Notes expose us to potentially unfavorable adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes. We have not entered into forward exchange contracts related to our foreign currency exposure. While we record financial results and assets and liabilities from our international operations in the functional currency, which is generally the local currency, these results are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in US dollars. Therefore, our reported results are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the local currencies, in particular the Euro and the Canadian dollar. In addition, we may fund certain cash flow requirements of our international operations including the interest and principal payment obligations, while due in Euros, on our 2024 notes in US dollars. Accordingly, in the event that the local currencies strengthen versus the US dollar to a greater extent than planned, the revenues, expenses and cash flow requirements associated with our international operations may be significantly higher in US-dollar terms than planned. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our foreign activities accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenue. A 1% change in foreign exchange rates would impact our consolidated annual revenue by approximately $1.1 million. A 1% change in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020 would impact the reported value of our 2024 Notes by approximately $4.3 million. Changes in foreign currency rates could adversely and materially affect our operating results and cash flow.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. Interest rate risk is limited due to the fixed interest rates of the company's note obligations, while foreign currency exchange risk is due to the company's operations outside of the United States and its 2024 Notes. A 1% change in foreign exchange rates would impact the company's consolidated annual revenue by approximately $1.1 million and the reported value of its 2024 Notes by approximately $4.3 million. Changes in foreign currency rates could adversely and materially affect the company's operating results and cash flow."}

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, 47.4% of our portfolio investments (based on fair value) paid variable interest rates, 25.7% paid fixed interest rates, 20.3% were income producing preferred equity and equity/other investments and the remainder (6.6%) consisted of non-income producing preferred equity and equity/other investments. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to the variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the subordinated incentive fee on income and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to FS/EIG Advisor with respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income.\nPursuant to the terms of each credit facility and financing arrangement, all credit facilities and financing arrangements, with the exception of the Senior Secured Notes, borrow at a floating rate based on a benchmark interest rate. Under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, we pay interest to the holders of such notes at a fixed rate. To the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we or any of our subsidiaries enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we or our subsidiaries have such debt outstanding or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments.\nThe following table shows the effect over a twelve-month period of changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense and net interest income, assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our borrowing arrangements in effect as of December 31, 2019 (dollar amounts are presented in thousands):\nWe expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt.

An Interference is an administrative proceeding within the USPTO that is used to determine which party was the first to invent an invention that is claimed in two (or more) independently owned patent applications.\nOn February 27, 2019, the USPTO ruled in favor of Health Discovery Corporation on the SVM-RFE Patents in the Interference proceeding between Health Discovery Corporation and Intel Corporation. The PTAB of the USPTO issued its decision, finding that Health Discovery Corporation is entitled to claim\nexclusive rights to the SVM-RFE technology as set forth in the pending patent application that was filed to provoke the Interference. The decision, issued by Administrative Patent Judge James Moore, ordered Intel\u2019s patent to be cancelled. The decision also dismissed Intel\u2019s motions challenging the validity of Health Discovery Corporation\u2019s pending claims and issued patents covering SVM-RFE. Health Discovery Corporation is currently evaluating its options for further action regarding this matter.\nAs previously disclosed, on February 7, 2020 two shareholders of HDC, William F.

Among the items in the motion, Quirk and Bear requested to have a special meeting of the shareholders and Quick and Bear alleged misconduct by the Company and its directors.\nOn March 2, 2020, having received no relief, Quirk and Bear dismissed their action in DeKalb County and filed a new lawsuit in Fulton County Superior Court based on substantially similar allegations and seeking similar relief. On March 4, 2020, the Fulton County court ordered a hearing on the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order against the Company for the following day.\nAt the hearing on March 5, 2020, Quirk and Bear presented their version of the facts through affidavits submitted by both Quirk and Bear, arguing that the affidavits supported the emergency relief they sought. The judge denied the motion and did not enter a temporary restraining order. The court set an evidentiary hearing on Quirk and Bear\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction for March 27, 2020. This hearing was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has not been rescheduled.\nQuirk and Bear filed this suit after attempting to call a special meeting of shareholders and making a demand for inspection of certain books and records. The demand for a special meeting was defective for a number of reasons, but as HDC announced in December, HDC will hold an annual meeting after the Company files its annual report on Form 10-K.

Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to our net equity position reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not currently hedge our equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. We recorded cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation losses in stockholders\u2019 equity of $16.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and $23.8 million as of December 31, 2019. We recorded unrealized foreign currency translation gains in other comprehensive income of $7.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor purposes of consolidation, revenue, expenses, gains, and losses related to our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period. As a result, our consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as revenue and segment operating income (loss) of our foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period to period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed. Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons. We do not currently hedge our net earnings exposure arising from the translation of our foreign revenue and segment operating income (loss).

A hypothetical change of 10% in the Euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2020 operating loss of approximately $0.4 million.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk, as our foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.\nWe are exposed to short-term and long-term interest rate risk on certain of our debt obligations. A hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would result in a change to 2020 interest expense of approximately $2 million.\nWe do not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur variable rate floor plan facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility, the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and our other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates. The total outstanding balance of such variable instruments after considering the effect of outstanding cash flow hedge instruments was approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and approximately $0.9 billion at December 31, 2018. A change of 100 basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately $16.4 million in 2019 and approximately $11.5 million in 2018. Of the total change in interest expense, approximately $14.1 million and $9.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, would have resulted from our floor plan facilities.\nIn addition to our variable rate debt, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, certain of our dealership lease facilities had monthly lease payments that fluctuated based on LIBOR interest rates. An increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would not have had a significant impact on rent expense in 2019 and 2018 due to the leases containing LIBOR floors which were above the LIBOR rate during 2019 and 2018.\nAs of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had interest rate cap agreements to limit our exposure to increases in LIBOR rates above certain levels. Under the terms of the interest rate cap agreements, interest rates reset monthly. The fair value of the interest rate cap positions at December 31, 2019 was a net asset of approximately $0.1 million, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the interest rate cap positions at December 31, 2018 was a net asset of approximately $4.8 million, with approximately $3.0 million included in other assets and approximately $1.8 million included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the terms of these agreements, we will receive and pay interest based on the following:\n(1) Under these interest rate caps, no payment from the counterparty will occur unless the stated receive rate exceeds the stated cap rate. If this occurs, a net payment to us from the counterparty based on the spread between the receive rate and the cap rate will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense, other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n(2) The one-month LIBOR rate was approximately 1.763% at December 31, 2019. These interest rate caps have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and, as a result, changes in the fair value of these interest rate caps are recorded in total other comprehensive income (loss) before taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nAbsent the acceleration of payments of principal that may result from non-compliance with financial and operational covenants under our various indebtedness, future principal maturities of variable and fixed rate debt and related interest rate caps are as follows:\n(1) Based on amounts outstanding at January 1 of each respective period.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe purchase certain of our new vehicle and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and, to a lesser extent, commodities. To reduce such risks, we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures, which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included within Note 9, \u201cDerivatives\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Currency Risk-We maintain operations in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Our non-U.S. operations, the largest of which are located in the Netherlands (and other countries whose functional currency is the Euro), the United Kingdom, Australia, the United Arab Emirates and China, have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Under certain conditions, we enter into hedging transactions, primarily forward foreign currency swaps, that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of\nforeign currency exchange rate risk (see Note 9, \u201cDerivatives\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information). We do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions, as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures.\nThe strengthening of the U.S. dollar can have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and financial position as foreign denominated operating results are translated into U.S. dollars. To illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the translation of our results of operations, annual sales and operating profit were remeasured assuming a ten percent reduction in foreign exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. Under this assumption, annual sales would have been $26 million lower and operating profit would have been $3 million higher for the twelve months ended August 31, 2019. This sensitivity analysis assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar and excludes the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have on actual sales or price levels. Similarly, a ten percent decline in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar on our August 31, 2019 financial position would result in a $35 million reduction to equity (accumulated other comprehensive loss), as a result of non U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities being translated into U.S. dollars, our reporting currency.\nInterest Rate Risk-We manage interest expense using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates impacts the fair value of our 5.625% Senior Notes, but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest rate on such debt is fixed. Our variable-rate debt obligations consist primarily of revolver and term loan borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. A ten percent increase in the average cost of our variable rate debt would have resulted in an approximate $1 million increase in financing costs for the year-ended August 31, 2019.\nCommodity Risk-We source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials, such as steel and plastic resin, are subject to price fluctuations which could have a negative impact on our results. We strive to timely pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary:\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodities.

(\"Varian\") brought suit against us in the United States District Court, for the Northern District of California, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents held by Varian. By order of the Court, those proceedings were bifurcated into an initial phase to determine the validity of the Varian patents and our infringement (if any), and a secondary phase to determine damages to Varian (if any) and whether our infringement (if shown) was willful. On April 13, 1999, the Court issued an interlocutory order construing the meaning of the terms of the patent claims at issue in the action. In September 1999, a hearing was held on a summary judgment motion which might dispose of a number of Varian's claims, but the Court has not yet issued a final ruling on that motion. Accordingly, to date, there has been no determination as to the actual scope of those claims, or whether our products have infringed or are infringing Varian's patents. A trial date previously scheduled for March 2000 was vacated, pending the court's decision of certain motions. There have been no findings in the action, which have caused us reasonably to believe that any infringement, if found, or any damages, if awarded, would have a material adverse effect on our operating results or our financial position.\nIn September 1999, Tegal Corporation (\"Tegal\") brought suit against us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents held by Tegal.

{"section": "ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.\nIn December 2010, in a non-unanimous decision, a Brazilian appellate court overturned a 2003 trial court which had previously ruled in favor of our Brazilian subsidiary related to the imposition of certain taxes on payments abroad related to the licensing of commercial software products, commonly referred to as \u201cCIDE tax\u201d. We estimate the total exposure related to CIDE tax, including interest, was approximately $18.2 million at January 31, 2020. The Brazilian subsidiary has appealed the unfavorable ruling to the Supreme Court and Superior Court, Brazil's two highest appellate courts. Based on the legal opinion of outside counsel, we believe that the chances of success on appeal of this matter are favorable and the Brazilian subsidiary intends to vigorously defend its position that the CIDE tax is not due. Accordingly, we have not recorded an accrual for the total estimated CIDE tax exposure. However, due to the lack of predictability of the Brazilian court system, we have concluded that it is reasonably possible that the Brazilian subsidiary may incur a loss up to the total exposure described above. We believe the resolution of this litigation will not be material to our consolidated net assets or liquidity.\nThe French Autorit\u00e9 de la Concurrence (\u201cCompetition Authority\u201d) began in 2013 an investigation into the French market for certain products of Apple, Inc., for which we are a distributor. In March 2020, the Competition Authority imposed fines on us, on another distributor, and on Apple, finding that we entered into an anticompetitive agreement with Apple regarding volume allocations of Apple products. The fine imposed on us was \u20ac76 million. We have vigorously contested the arguments of the Competition Authority, and we intend to appeal its determination to the French courts, seeking to set aside or reduce the fine. We believe we have strong arguments on appeal, but we are unable to predict the outcome, among other reasons because of the novelty of the case and the unprecedented size of the fines imposed, or how long it will take to achieve a final resolution. Under French law, however, the pendency of our appeal does not suspend the obligation to pay the fine, and we expect that we will be required to pay the full fine assessed by the Competition Authority before our appeal is finally determined. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of loss in these proceedings and therefore have not accrued for any loss.\nAs disclosed in the Company's definitive proxy statement related to the Merger dated January 10, 2020 (the \"Merger Proxy Statement\"), as supplemented by the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 4, 2020 (the \u201cSupplemental Disclosure 8-K\u201d), five lawsuits related to the Merger were filed between December 19, 2019 and January 27, 2020 comprised of one purported class action complaint brought on behalf of a putative class of the Company\u2019s shareholders and four individual shareholder complaints (collectively, the \u201cMerger Litigations\u201d). The Merger Litigations alleged, among other things, that the Company\u2019s disclosures set forth in the Merger Proxy Statement contained material omissions. As described in the Supplemental Disclosure 8-K, while the Company believes that the Merger Litigations are without merit and no supplemental disclosure was required under applicable law, in order to moot the plaintiffs\u2019 unmeritorious disclosure claims in the Merger Litigations, to avoid the risk of the Merger Litigations delaying or adversely affecting the Merger, and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company determined to voluntarily supplement the Merger Proxy Statement as described in the Supplemental Disclosure 8-K.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe follow discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe have no significant interest-bearing assets and our convertible promissory notes and short-term loans are fixed rate securities. Our current exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest income generated by our cash deposits in banks and the fair value of our invested securities. Although we do not believe that interest rate has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, increase in interest rates in the future could increase interest cost on our new debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt and limit our acquisition and development activities.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWhile our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are substantially denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB. If the RMB depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline. If the RMB appreciates against the U.S. dollar, any new RMB-denominated investments or expenditures will be more costly to us. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates while stockholders\u2019 equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. Since July 2005, the RMB has not been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nInflation Risk\nInflationary factors such as increases in the costs to acquire advertising rights and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues if the selling prices of our services do not increase with these increased costs.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risk disclosures of a company, including their exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK:\nThe following discussion about the Company's market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Company has market risk related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not generally use derivative financial instruments in connection with these market risks, except as noted below.\nInterest Rates - The Company's most significant long-term instrument is the domestic credit facility, which bears interest at variable rates based on LIBOR (Euro-LIBOR for balances drawn in Euros).\nThe following table presents information related to interest rate contracts entered into by the Company and designated as cash flow hedges:\nThe interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the future variable interest payments which are considered probable of occurring. Based on the Company's assessment, all the critical terms of each of the hedges matched the underlying terms of the hedged debt and related forecasted interest payments, and as such, these hedges were considered highly effective.\nThe fair value of the interest rate swaps reflected an unrealized loss, of $7.8 million ($5.9 million after-tax) at September 30, 2020 that is included in equity as part of AOCI. A decrease of 10% in market interest rates (e.g., a decrease from 5.0% to 4.5%) would result in a decrease of approximately $1.0 million in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.\nCommodity Price Risks - In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price fluctuations related to the purchases of certain materials and supplies (such as bronze ingot, steel, granite, fuel and wood) used in its manufacturing operations. The Company obtains competitive prices for materials and supplies when available. In addition, based on competitive market conditions and to the extent that the Company has established pricing terms with customers through contracts or similar arrangements, the Company's ability to immediately increase the price of its products to offset the increased costs may be limited.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates - The Company is subject to changes in various foreign currency exchange rates, primarily including the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, and Australian Dollar in the conversion from local currencies to the U.S. dollar of the reported financial position and operating results of its non-U.S. based subsidiaries. An adverse change (strengthening U.S. dollar) of 10% in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in reported sales of $49.1 million and a decrease in reported operating income of $5.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, (continued)\nActuarial Assumptions - The most significant actuarial assumptions affecting pension expense and pension obligations include the valuation of retirement plan assets, the discount rates and the estimated return on plan assets. The estimated return on plan assets is currently based upon projections provided by the Company's independent investment advisor, considering the investment policy of the plan and the plan's asset allocation. The fair value of plan assets and discount rates are \"point-in-time\" measures, and volatility of the debt and equity markets makes estimating future changes in fair value of plan assets and discount rates challenging. The Company elected to value its principal retirement and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities using a modified assumption of future mortality that reflects a significant improvement in life expectancy over the previous mortality assumptions. Refer to Note 14, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Plans\" in Item 8", "summary": "of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and actuarial assumptions.

A decrease of 10% in market interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $1.0 million in the fair value of the interest rate swaps, while an adverse change of 10% in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in reported sales of $49.1 million and a decrease in reported operating income of $"}

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes. Specifically, as of December 30, 2020, borrowings under our credit facility bore interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum.\nWe have receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the forecasted cash flows of our floating rate debt. A summary of our interest rate swaps as of December 30, 2020 is as follows:\n(1) The notional amount of the swaps entered into on February 15, 2018 increases annually beginning September 30, 2020 until they reach the maximum notional amount of $425.0 million on September 28, 2029.\nAs of December 30, 2020, the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps was in excess of 100% of our floating rate debt. Based on the levels of borrowings under the credit facility at December 30, 2020, if interest rates changed by 100 basis points, our annual cash flow and income before taxes would not change. However, depending on market considerations, fluctuations in the fair values of our interest rate swaps could be significant. With the exception of these changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and in the levels of borrowings under our credit facility, there have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative market risks since the prior reporting period. For additional information related to our interest rate swaps, including changes in the fair value, refer to Notes 7, 9 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe purchase certain food products, such as beef, poultry, pork, eggs and coffee, and utilities such as gas and electricity, that are affected by commodity pricing and are, therefore, subject to price volatility caused by weather, production problems, delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control and which are generally unpredictable. Changes in commodity prices affect us and our competitors, generally and often simultaneously. In general, we purchase food products and utilities based upon market prices established with vendors. Although many of the items purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices, the majority of our purchasing arrangements are structured to contain features that minimize price volatility by establishing fixed pricing and/or price ceilings and floors. We use these types of purchase arrangements to control costs as an alternative to using financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. In many cases, we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long-term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy. However, competitive circumstances could limit such actions and, in those circumstances, increases in commodity prices could lower our margins. Because of the often short-term nature of commodity pricing aberrations and our ability to change menu pricing or product delivery strategies in response to commodity price increases, we believe that the impact of commodity price risk is not significant.\nWe have established a process to identify, control and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and other relevant rates and prices. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary:\nThe company has exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that a company will incur losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We have exposure to three principal types of market risk through our investment activities: interest rate risk, credit risk and equity risk. Our primary market risk exposure is changes in interest rates. We have not entered, and do not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for hedging, trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that a company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Our exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from our significant holdings of fixed rate investments. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value of these securities.\nThe average duration of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 was 3.1 years. Our fixed maturity investments include U.S. government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, obligations of state and local governments and governmental authorities, and corporate bonds, most of which are exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates and which may experience moderate fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates. We hold these investments as available for sale. This allows us to manage our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations through active review of our investment portfolio by management, our investment adviser and our board of directors.\nFluctuations in near-term interest rates could impact our results of operations and operating cash flows. Certain of these securities may have call features. In a declining interest rate environment these securities may be called by their issuer and replaced with securities bearing lower interest rates. If we are required to sell these securities in a rising interest rate environment, then we may recognize losses.\nAs a general matter, we attempt to match the durations of our assets with the durations of our liabilities. Our investment objectives include maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operational needs and optimizing our after-tax investment income and our after-tax total return, all of which are subject to our tolerance for risk.\nThe table below shows the interest rate sensitivity on our fixed maturity investments measured in terms of fair value (which is equal to the carrying value for all of our investment securities that are subject to interest rate changes) at December 31, 2019:\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer. We address this risk by investing primarily in fixed maturity securities that are rated at least \u201cA\u201d by Moody\u2019s or an equivalent rating quality. We also independently, and through our outside investment manager, monitor the financial condition of all the issuers of fixed maturity securities in our portfolio. To limit our exposure to risk, we employ diversification rules that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or asset class.\nEquity Risk\nEquity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses on our equity securities due to adverse changes in equity prices.\nImpact of Inflation\nIncreases in the cost of medical procedures and related services can affect the losses that we may incur in connection with resolving claims under policies that we issue. These cost increases reduce profit margins to the extent that rate increases are not implemented on an adequate and timely basis. We, like all insurance companies, establish insurance premium levels before the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses, or the extent to which inflation may impact these expenses, are known. Therefore, we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation when establishing rates. Because inflation has remained relatively low in recent years, our financial results have not been significantly affected by it.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that a company may face, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, and equity risk.

It also limits its exposure to risk by investing primarily in fixed maturity securities that are rated at least \"A\" by Moody's.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNCRIC's investment portfolio is exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and equity price risk. Market risk is the potential for financial losses due to the decrease in the value or price of an asset resulting from broad movements in prices. At December 31, 2000, fixed maturity securities comprised 93% of total investments at market value. U.S. government and tax-exempt bonds represent 30% of the fixed maturity securities. Equity securities, consisting primarily of preferred stock, account for the remainder of the investment portfolio. NCRIC has classified its investments as available for sale.\nBecause of the high percentage of fixed maturity securities, interest rate risk represents the highest exposure NCRIC has on its investment portfolio. In general, the market value of NCRIC's fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuation in interest rates. During periods of rising interest rates, the fair value of NCRIC's investment portfolio will generally decline resulting in decreases in NCRIC's stockholders' equity. Conversely, during periods of falling interest rates, the fair value of NCRIC's investment portfolio will generally increase resulting in increases in NCRIC's stockholders' equity. In addition, NCRIC's net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes on monies reinvested from maturing securities and investments of positive cash flow from operating activities.\nGenerally, the longer the duration of the security, the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations. To control the adverse effects of the changes in interest rates, NCRIC's investment portfolio of fixed maturity securities consists primarily of intermediate-term, investment-grade securities. NCRIC's investment policy also provides that all security purchases be limited to rated securities or unrated securities approved by management on the recommendation of NCRIC's investment advisor. Approximately 69% of the portfolio is Treasury or Agency related or rated AAA, the highest rating for a security.\nOne common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity securities is effective duration. Effective duration utilizes maturities, yields, and call terms to calculate an average age of expected cash flows. The following table shows the estimated fair value of NCRIC's fixed maturity portfolio based on fluctuations in the market interest rates.\nProjected Market Value Yield Change (bp) Market Yield (in thousands) ----------------- ------------ -------------- -300 3.24 $112.1 -200 4.24 106.8 -100 5.25 101.9 Current Yield** 6.25 97.2 100 7.25 92.5 200 8.26 88.1 300 9.26 83.9\n** Current yield is as of December 31, 2000.\nThe actual impact of the market interest rate changes on the securities may differ from those shown in the sensitivity analysis above.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: NCRIC's investment portfolio is exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and equity price risk.

Our current investment policy limits investment in non-investment grade debt securities, and limits total investments in preferred stock, common stock and mortgage notes receivables. We also comply with applicable laws and regulations that further restrict the type, quality and concentration of our investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, and preferred and common equity securities.\nOur investment policy was established by the Investment Committee of our Board of Directors and is reviewed regularly. Pursuant to this investment policy, our fixed-maturity portfolio is classified as available for sale and we report any unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred income taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) within our stockholders\u2019 equity.

The Company may from time to time be exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments, but is not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk. The Company manages exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities.\nOur operations are interest rate sensitive. As overall manufactured housing demand can be adversely affected by increases in interest rates, a significant increase in wholesale or mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of distributors and home buyers to secure financing. Higher interest rates could unfavorably impact our revenues, gross margins and net earnings.\nCountryPlace is exposed to market risk related to the accessibility and terms of long-term financing of its loans. In the past, CountryPlace accessed the asset-backed securities market to provide term financing of its home-only and non-conforming mortgage originations. At present, independent asset-backed and mortgage-backed securitization markets are not readily available to CountryPlace and other manufactured housing lenders. Accordingly, CountryPlace has not continued to securitize its loan originations as a means to obtain long-term funding.\nThe Company is also exposed to market risks related to our consumer and commercial loan notes receivables, as well as our securitized financings balances. For fixed and step rate instruments, changes in interest rates do not change future earnings and cash flows. However, changes in interest rates could affect the fair value of these instruments. Assuming the level of these instruments as of March 30, 2019, is held constant, a 1% (100 basis points) unfavorable change in average interest rates would adversely impact the fair value of these instruments, as follows (in thousands):\nIn originating loans for sale, CountryPlace issues interest rate lock commitments (\"IRLCs\") to prospective borrowers and third-party originators. These IRLCs represent an agreement to extend credit to a loan applicant, whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to loan closing or sale. These IRLCs bind CountryPlace to fund the approved loan at the specified rate regardless of whether interest rates or market prices for similar loans have changed between the commitment date and the closing date. As such, outstanding IRLCs are subject to interest rate risk and related loan sale price risk during the period from the date of the IRLC through the earlier of the loan sale date or IRLC expiration date. The loan commitments generally range between 30 and 180 days; however, borrowers are not obligated to close the related loans. As a result, CountryPlace is subject to fallout risk related to IRLCs, which is realized if approved borrowers choose not to close on the loans within the terms of the IRLCs. As of March 30, 2019, CountryPlace had outstanding IRLCs with a notional amount of $14.7 million recorded at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The estimated fair values of IRLCs are based on quoted market values and are recorded in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of IRLCs is based on the value of the underlying loan adjusted for: (i) estimated cost to complete and originate the loan and (ii) the estimated percentage or IRLCs that will result in closed loans. The initial and subsequent changes in the value of IRLCs are a component of current income. Assuming CountryPlace\u2019s level of IRLCs is held constant, a 1% (100 basis points) increase in average interest rates would decrease the fair value of CountryPlace\u2019s obligations by approximately $55,000.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nCountryPlace is exposed to market risk related to interest rates, loan origination, and loan sale prices.

Credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults. Default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, borrower financial condition, property performance, property management, supply/demand factors, construction trends, consumer behavior, regional economics, interest rates, the strength of the U.S. economy, and other factors beyond our control. All loans are subject to some risk of default. We manage credit risk through the underwriting process and investment structuring process, acquiring our investments at the appropriate discount to face value, if any, and establishing loss assumptions. We also carefully monitor the performance of the loans, as well as external factors that may affect their value.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to interest rate fluctuations. Many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we may borrow funds at fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. We do not hold or issue derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign denominated investments, and thus, we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment portfolio was 97% variable rate investments based on LIBOR for various terms.

JOHN SEITZ, ET AL.\nIn October 1999, the Company, and two former officers of DTI, were named as defendants in a breach of contract and intentional tort action brought by Daniel Boudwin who claims rights to computer software products once offered for sale by subsidiaries of the Company. This action is pending in Pennsylvania's Delaware Court of Common Pleas. The plaintiff is seeking payment of one-half of all the sales proceeds of the commercial software product line of \"Special Delivery\" from February 1997 to the present and makes claim to one-half of the asset purchase price (as apportioned to the \"Special Delivery\" asset) paid by the Company to the shareholders of DTI in April 1999. The Company and its subsidiaries have indemnification rights against one of the selling shareholders in connection with his representations and warranties made about \"Special Delivery\" in various documents. Although the Company and its subsidiaries support the selling shareholder's position as it relates to the plaintiff in this action, cross-claims have been filed against the selling shareholder, for indemnification and contribution, for further protection. Management is unable to determine whether the outcome of this complaint will have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOTHER PROCEEDINGS\nThe Company is aware of at least seven lawsuits in which the Company, Richard P. Stack, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Horace M. Hertz, the former Chief Financial Officer of the Company, have been sued in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the \"Court\") for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The names of the plaintiffs and the dates the cases were filed with the Court are as follows: Jay Spechler filed his action with the Court on October 11, 2000, Mark Michelson filed his action with the Court on October 13, 2000, Donald Wilkens filed his action with the Court on October 17, 2000 and Robert D.

The actions and notices refer to the following locations, none of which involve real estate we ever owned or upon which we ever conducted operations: the Sapp Battery Site in Cottondale, Florida, the Interstate Lead Company Site in Leeds, Alabama, the Ross Metals Site in Rossville, Tennessee, the Li Tungsten Site in Glen Cove, New York, the Peak Oil Site in Tampa, Florida, the R&H Oil Site in San Antonio, Texas, the SoGreen/Parramore Site in Tifton, Georgia, the Jensen Drive site in Houston, Texas, the Industrial Salvage site in Corpus Christi, Texas, Chemetco site in Hartford, Illinois and the Ward Transformer site in Raleigh, North Carolina. We may contest our designation as a PRP with regard to certain sites, while at other sites we are participating with other named PRPs in agreements or negotiations that have resulted or that we expect will result in agreements to remediate the sites.

We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.\nWe have policies governing our use of derivative instruments, and we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBy using derivative instruments, we are subject to credit and market risk. The derivative instruments are booked in our balance sheet at fair value and reflect the asset or liability position as of September 30, 2019. If a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract, our exposure will equal the fair value of the derivative. Generally, when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes Cabot, thus creating a payment risk for Cabot. We minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into these transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. Our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur international operations are subject to certain risks, including currency exchange rate fluctuations and government actions.

In fiscal year 2019, foreign currency translations in the aggregate decreased our business segment EBIT by $6 million, the majority of which affected the results of the Performance Chemicals segment. The overall unfavorable impact was driven by the translation of local currency denominated revenues and costs in Europe. In addition, we recognized a net foreign exchange gain of less than $1 million in Other income (expense) in fiscal 2019 from the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities from transactional currencies to functional currency, largely attributable to changes in the value of the Argentine Peso, partially offset by unfavorable movements in the Euro during the year.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Cabot is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates due to its financing activities and foreign currency transactions.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates, other relevant market rates or price changes. The volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk. The following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of December 31, 2019. Our market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities, which are available-for-sale and not held for trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of our investment portfolio, excluding cash and cash equivalents, was $169.7 million and $140.1 million, respectively. Our investment portfolio consists principally of investment-grade, fixed-income securities, classified as debt securities. Accordingly, the primary market risk exposure to our debt portfolio is interest rate risk. In general, the fair market value of a portfolio of fixed-income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in market interest rates, while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed-income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates. We attempt to mitigate interest rate risks by investing in securities with varied maturity dates and by managing the duration of our investment portfolio to a defined range of three to four years. The duration-to-worst average of the debt securities portfolio was 3.0 and 3.1 years as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe table below summarizes our interest rate risk. The table also illustrates the sensitivity of the fair value of our investments, classified as debt securities and short-term investments, to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2019. The selected scenarios are not predictions of future events, but rather illustrate the effect that events may have on the fair value of the fixed-income portfolio and shareholders\u2019 equity (dollars in thousands).\nCredit Risk\nAn additional exposure to our debt securities portfolio is credit risk. We manage our credit risk by investing only in investment-grade securities. In addition, we comply with applicable statutory requirements which limit the portion of our total investment portfolio that we can invest in any one security.\nWe are subject to credit risks with respect to our reinsurers. Although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage which it assumes, our reinsurance contracts do not discharge our insurance companies from primary liability to each policyholder for the full amount of the applicable policy, and consequently our insurance companies remain obligated to pay claims in accordance with the terms of the policies regardless of whether a reinsurer fulfills or defaults on its obligations under the related reinsurance agreement. To mitigate our credit risk to reinsurance companies, we attempt to select financially strong reinsurers with an A.M. Best rating of \"A-\" or better and continue to evaluate their financial condition throughout the duration of our agreements.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net amount due to the Company from reinsurers, including prepaid reinsurance, was $29.0 million and $36.6 million, respectively. We believe all amounts recorded as due from reinsurers are recoverable.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our results of operations, except for the effect that inflation may have on interest rates and claims costs. We consider the effects of inflation in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and LAE. The actual effects of inflation on our results are not known until claims are ultimately settled. In addition to general price inflation, we are exposed to a long-term upward trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk exposures of a company and how they are managed.

{"section": "ITEM 1: BUSINESS\nDescription of Business\nOriginal Sixteen to One Mine, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in 1911 in California. It mines gold on properties it owns under fee simple grant deeds. The Alleghany Mining District is about 65 miles northeast of the intersection of I-80 and California State Route 49.\nSixteen to One mine from which more than 1,113,266 troy ounces of gold have been retrieved is the primary operation. It is a traditional hard rock underground mine where miners create horizontal levels at various elevations and raise into favorable areas. Geology of the mineral deposit is well documented. Gold is not distributed evenly within the quartz veins; however, concentrations of gold deposits are found scattered within these quartz veins, in recognized ore shoots. Because the gold appears intermittently, the Company has never declared reserves according to contemporary industry standards.\nOperations are characterized by significant amounts of preparation, tunneling, underground maintenance and upgrading. The Company from time to time focuses substantially all of its resources on infrastructure development or maintenance. During these periods little gold is mined. At other times, miners are primarily exploring for gold. Accordingly, business is subjected to very different cycles: one dependent on whether the Company is directing its resources towards infrastructure or underground development and the other is gold production. The operation resembles the classical \"boom or bust\" cycles regardless of outside influences.\nMetal detection technology enables exploration to detect gold from zero to 48 inches from quartz faces in the wall rock.(The size of the concentration is a factor).\nAdvancement in off the shelf metal detection technology has steadily progressed over the past twenty years. Greater sensitivity in metal detectors has historically increased gold production throughout the mine. It is impossible to predict when new devices will be developed. Twenty-first century detection skills have yet to find the Sixteen to One.\nFor accounting purposes gold revenues are accrued when the metal is recovered. For tax purposes revenues are not recognized until the gold is sold. Rare high-grade gold and quartz is sold at a premium to museums, collectors and jewelry manufacturers. This market is a significant financial factor with revenue significantly greater than prevailing spot price. Demand for the Sixteen to One gold quartz gemstone is greater than the amount mined.\nThe Company lacks sufficient funds to implement its long-term construction projects: sinking a new shaft in the center of the property is a long-standing objective. Other Company projects are: joining a public stock exchange, building and testing a gold detector specifically designed for the Sixteen to One vein and dewatering the entire mine.\nSupplies and equipment used for underground exploration are commonly available. Labor requirements are available, but are a concern throughout the mining industry.\nNo particular seasonality exists for the marketing of gold. Adverse effects of winter storms sometimes limit the ability of the crew to access the mine. Management believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment. The Company does not presently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, either for the remainder of its current fiscal year or for the succeeding fiscal year.\nThe Company's executive office is located at 527 Miners Street, Alleghany, California 95910.

{"section": "Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe conduct certain operations in foreign currencies. We enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion, but not all, of existing foreign currency denominated amounts. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in\nOther income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on the currency forward exchange contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates as of December 26, 2020. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We recognized a net loss from our foreign exchange of $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively in fiscal 2020 and 2018, and a net gain of $0.4 million in fiscal 2019.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We invest in a number of securities including U.S. agency discount notes, money market funds and commercial paper. We attempt to maintain the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in high grade investment securities. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to an issuer, except U.S. Treasuries and U.S. agencies.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk arising from our Term Loan (see Note 5, Debt, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) is insignificant as a result of the interest-rate swap agreement (see Note 7, Derivative Financial Instruments, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) that we entered into with Union Bank to hedge the interest payments on our Building Term Loan.\nWe use interest rate derivative instruments to manage certain interest rate exposures. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

We are exposed to market risks related to interest rates on our cash and equivalents and interest rates and market price sensitivity on our debt obligations. We monitor the effects of market changes on interest rates and manage interest rate risks by investing in short-term cash equivalents with market rates of interest and by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt obligations.\nOur credit agreement permits borrowings at a variable rate of interest. On January 26, 2019, we had variable rate debt outstanding under our credit agreement of $450.0 million under our term loan facilities. Interest related to these borrowings fluctuates based on LIBOR or the base rate of the bank administrative agent of the credit agreement. At the current level of borrowings, for every 50 basis point change in the interest rate, interest expense associated with such borrowings would correspondingly change by approximately $2.3 million annually.\nIn September 2015, we issued $485.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d), which bear a fixed rate of interest of 0.75%. Due to the fixed rate of interest on the Notes, changes in market rates of interest would not have an impact on the related interest expense. However, there exists market risk sensitivity on the fair value of the fixed rate Notes with respect to changes in market interest rates. Generally, the fair value of the fixed rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the Notes is affected by the price and volatility of our common stock and will generally increase or decrease as the market price of our common stock changes.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amount and fair value of the Notes, net of the debt discount and debt issuance costs. The fair value of the Notes is based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the respective periods (Level 2), which was $96.31 and $136.01 as of January 26, 2019 and January 27, 2018, respectively (dollars in thousands):\nA hypothetical 50 basis point change in the market interest rates in effect would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the Notes of approximately $7.2 million, calculated on a discounted cash flow basis as of January 26, 2019.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with counterparties for the purpose of reducing the potential dilution to common stockholders from the conversion of the Notes and offsetting any potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the Notes. In the event that shares or cash are deliverable to holders of the Notes upon conversion at limits defined in the indenture governing the Notes, counterparties to the convertible note hedge will be required to deliver to us up to 5.006 million shares of our common stock or pay cash to us in a similar amount as the value that we deliver to the holders of the Notes based on a conversion price of $96.89 per share. The convertible note hedge is intended to offset potential dilution from the Notes.\nWe also entered into separately negotiated warrant transactions with the same counterparties as the convertible note hedge transactions whereby we sold warrants to purchase, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments, up to 5.006 million shares of our common stock at a price of $130.43 per share. We expect to settle the warrant transactions on a net share basis. See Note 13, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of these debt transactions.\nWe also have market risk for foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in Canada.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily consist of interest rates, raw material prices and inflation as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur cash consists of amounts held by third-party financial institutions. In May 2019, upon closing of our IPO, we adopted an investment policy which has as its primary objective investment activities which preserve principal without significantly increasing risk.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our SVB Credit Facilities and our equipment loan facility. See \u201c-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Facilities\u201d and \u201c-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Equipment Loan Facility\u201d above. Based on the average interest rate on our SVB Credit Facilities and equipment loan facility in 2019 and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding, we do not believe that a 1.0% change in the interest rate would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIngredient Risk\nWe are exposed to risk related to the price and availability of our ingredients because our profitability is dependent on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to raw material and food costs. Currently, the main ingredient in our products is pea protein, which we source from Canada, France and the United States. The prices of pea protein and other ingredients we use are subject to many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow yellow peas, the vagaries of these farming businesses, including poor harvests due to adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and pestilence, and changes in national and world economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we purchase some ingredients and other materials offshore, and the price and availability of such ingredients and materials may be affected by political events or other conditions in these countries or tariffs or trade wars. As of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10% increase or 10% decrease in the weighted-average cost of pea protein, our primary ingredient, would have resulted in an increase of approximately $2.8 million or a decrease of approximately $2.8 million, respectively, to cost of goods sold. We are working to diversify our sources of supply and intend to enter into long-term contracts to better ensure stability of prices of our raw materials. In the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a multi-year sales agreement with Roquette for the supply of pea protein. See Note 12, Subsequent Events, to the Notes to Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nOur revenues and costs are denominated in U.S. dollars and are not subject to foreign exchange risk. However, to the extent our sourcing strategy changes or we commence generating net revenues outside of the United States that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our results of operations could be impacted by changes in exchange rates.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK is a disclosure of the market risks that Beyond Meat is exposed to in the ordinary course of its business.

(\u201cHEMG\u201d) and Mr. Patrick Spada sued the Company, certain senior management members and our directors in state court in New York seeking damages arising principally from (i) allegedly false and misleading statements in the filings with the SEC and DOE where the Company disclosed that HEMG and Mr. Spada borrowed $2.2 million without Board authority, (ii) the alleged breach of an April 2012 agreement whereby the Company had agreed, subject to numerous conditions and time limitations, to purchase certain shares of the Company from HEMG, and (iii) alleged diminution to the value of HEMG\u2019s shares of the Company due to Mr. Spada\u2019s disagreement with certain business transactions the Company engaged in, all with Board approval. On November 8, 2013, the state court in New York granted the Company\u2019s motion to dismiss nearly all of the claims. On December 10, 2013, the Company answered an amended complaint filed by HEMG and Mr. Spada in April 2013.\nOn December 10, 2013, the Company also filed a series of counterclaims against HEMG and Mr. Spada in the same state court of New York. By order dated August 4, 2014, the New York court denied HEMG and Spada\u2019s motion to dismiss the fraud counterclaim the Company asserted against them.\nThe litigation has been stayed since HEMG\u2019s 2015 bankruptcy filing.\nWhile the Company has been advised by its counsel that HEMG\u2019s and Spada\u2019s claims in the New York lawsuit is baseless, the Company cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate outcome of the case. Defending the lawsuit maybe expensive and will require the expenditure of time which could otherwise be spent on the Company\u2019s business. While unlikely, if Mr. Spada\u2019s and HEMG\u2019s claims in the New York litigation were to be successful, the damages the Company could pay could potentially be material.\nIn November 2014, the Company and Aspen University sued HEMG seeking to recover sums due under two 2008 Agreements where Aspen University sold course materials to HEMG in exchange for long-term future payments. On September 29, 2015, the Company and Aspen University obtained a default judgment in the amount of $772,793. This default judgment precipitated the bankruptcy petition discussed in the next paragraph.\nOn October 15, 2015, HEMG filed bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 7. As a result, the remaining claims and Aspen\u2019s counterclaims in the New York lawsuit are currently stayed. The bankrupt estate\u2019s sole asset consists of 208,000 shares of AGI common stock. The principal creditors are AGI which holds the judgment and has several other claims. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019, the Court reduced Aspen\u2019s unsecured claim to $888,632. The other primary claimant is a secured creditor which alleges it is owed a principal amount of $1,200,000.

{"section": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nOur subsidiary, Gulf Coast Services sponsors an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") that is the subject of an application before the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for a compliance statement under the Voluntary Compliance Resolution Program. The application was filed with the IRS on May 17, 2000. According to the application, Gulf Coast Services made large contributions to the ESOP plan and to its 401(k) plan during 1997 and 1998, which caused the two plans to allocate amounts to certain employees in excess of the limits set forth in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). The administrative committees for both plans sought to comply with the requirements of Code Section 415 by reducing employees' allocations under the ESOP plan before any reductions of allocations under the 401(k) plan. Although this approach is consistent with Treasury Regulations under Code Section 415, it may not have been consistent with the terms of the plan documents. The application requests a compliance statement to the effect that any failure to comply with the terms of the plans will not adversely affect the plans' tax- qualified status, conditioned upon the implementation of the specific corrections set forth in the compliance statement.\nWe estimate that the cost to the ESOP of the corrective allocation described above will be approximately $3.3 million. In the application, Gulf Coast Services has requested that the assets held in the Section 415 Suspense Account and in the ESOP Loan Suspense Account be used by the ESOP for the correction. The 415 Suspense Account has an approximate value of $1.6 million and the ESOP Loan Suspense Account has a value in excess of the $1.7 million needed for the full correction. At this time, we cannot be certain whether the IRS will allow use of funds in the 415 Suspense Account or in the ESOP Loan Suspense Account to be used as part of the corrective action. If the IRS does not allow the use of those funds, Gulf Coast Services may be required to contribute to the Plan the funds needed to make up any shortfall. However, Gulf Coast Services would first look to an escrow account established in connection with the sale of Gulf Coast Services by the sellers of Gulf Coast Services stock for reimbursement of any funds they may be required to contribute to the Plan to comply with the Code. The Company does not believe the IRS's decision will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are involved in other various claims, legal actions and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.

Our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand.\nOur risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. Certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to \u201ctake or pay\u201d for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of generally up to 5 years for physical commodity requirements and commodity transportation requirements, with some extending beyond, and for up to 13 years for air products.

The combination of the interest rate cap agreement and the terms of the credit facility result in the Company paying interest, on an amount of variable-rate debt equal to the notional amount of the interest rate cap agreement, at a variable rate (LIBOR plus 2.00%), not to exceed 9.50 percent.

As of June 28, 2019, the applicable margin based on our current credit ratings was 1.5%. Borrowings under our U.S. Term Loan B-4 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, of either an adjusted LIBOR (subject to a 0.0% floor) plus a margin of 1.75% or a base rate plus a margin of 0.75%.\nWe have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. At June 28, 2019, 68% of the par value of our debt was at variable rates. To balance the portfolio, we entered into pay-fixed interest rate swaps on $2.00 billion notional amount, which effectively converts a portion of our term loan to fixed rates through February 2023. As of June 28, 2019, we had $7.26 billion of variable rate debt. After giving effect to the $2.00 billion of interest rate swaps, we effectively had $5.26 billion of long-term debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by $53 million.\nFor additional information regarding our variable interest rate debt, see Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk provides disclosure about the company's exposure to foreign currency and other market risks.

{"section": "Item 1. Description of Business\nGeneral\nBioethics, Ltd., (the \u201cRegistrant\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a shell company that conducts no active business operations and is seeking business opportunities for acquisition or participation by the Company.\nHistory\nThe Company was incorporated in 1990 as a Nevada corporation. The Company has not yet generated any significant revenues.\nSince its organization in 1990, the Company has not engaged in active business operations and its activities have consisted of its search for and evaluation of potential business opportunities for acquisition or participation by the Company. During this period, the Company has incurred limited operating expenses necessary to maintain its status as a corporation in good standing and has incurred expenses in connection with its search for and evaluation of potential business opportunities. Due to the lack of active operations and the Company\u2019s stated purpose of seeking to acquire a currently unknown business opportunity, the Company may be classified as a \u201cshell\u201d company subject to all the risks of a new business together with the substantial risks associated with the search for and acquisition of business opportunities. Please see Item 9B. Other Information \u201cUnwind and Rescission of Transaction.\u201d\nBusiness Plan\nThe Company intends to continue to seek, investigate and, if warranted, acquire an interest in a business opportunity. Management has not established any firm criteria with respect to the type of business with which the Company desires to become involved and will consider participating in a business enterprise in a variety of different industries or areas with no limitation as to the geographical location of the enterprise. The Company\u2019s management will have unrestricted discretion in reviewing, analyzing, and ultimately selecting a business enterprise for acquisition or participation by the Company. It is anticipated that any enterprise ultimately selected will be selected by management based on its analysis and evaluation of the business and financial condition of the enterprise, as well as its business plan, potential for growth, and other factors, none of which can be anticipated to be controlling. If the Company is able to locate a suitable business enterprise, the decision to acquire or participate in the enterprise may be made by the Company\u2019s board of directors without stockholder approval. Approval may also be obtained pursuant to the consent of a majority of the Company\u2019s stockholders. Further, it is anticipated that the acquisition of or participation in an enterprise may involve the issuance by the Company of a controlling interest in the Company which would dilute the respective equity interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders and may also result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s net tangible asset value per share.\nThe activities of the Company will continue to be subject to several significant risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact that the Company has no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management which will, in all probability, act without the consent, vote, or approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders. The risks faced by the Company are further increased as a result of its limited resources and its inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with additional capital. (See \u201cItem 1A.", "summary": "Risk Factors\u201d).\n\nBioethics, Ltd. is a shell company that has been incorporated in Nevada since 1990 and has not generated any significant revenues.

The decision to acquire or participate in a business enterprise may be made by the company's board of directors without stockholder approval, and may involve the issuance of a controlling interest in the company, which would dilute the equity interests of the stockholders. The company faces several significant risks due to its lack of specific business and limited resources."}
{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest rate risk\nThe company has exposure to interest rate risk from its debt. In general, the company\u2019s long-term debt is fixed rate and, to the extent it has any, its short-term debt is variable rate. See Note 14, \u201cDebt,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for components of the company\u2019s long-term debt. The company believes that the market risk assuming a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of these financial instruments, or the related cash flows, or future results of operations.\nMarket risk\nAs of December 31, 2019, the company had outstanding $434.5 million ($440.0 million face value) of senior secured notes due 2022 and $80.0 million ($84.2 million face value) of convertible senior notes due 2021. The interest rates on these notes are fixed and therefore do not expose the company to risk related to rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the convertible senior notes was $115.8 million. In connection with the offering of the convertible senior notes, the company paid $27.3 million to purchase a capped call covering approximately 21.9 million shares of the company\u2019s common stock. If the price per share of the company\u2019s common stock is below $9.76, these capped call transactions would provide no benefit from potential dilution. If the price per share of the company\u2019s common stock is above $12.75, then to the extent of the excess, these capped call transactions would result in no additional benefit for potential dilution at conversion. As a result of the convertible note exchange in August 2019, the company unwound a pro rata portion of the capped call transactions and received proceeds of $7.2 million. Following the convertible note exchange, the capped call transactions remaining cover approximately 8.6 million shares of the company\u2019s common stock. See Note 14, \u201cDebt,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nThe company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks. The company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, can benefit from a weaker dollar, and can be adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may adversely affect consolidated revenue and operating margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Currency exposure gains and losses are mitigated by purchasing components and incurring expenses in local currencies.\nIn addition, the company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, to reduce its exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany balances. See Note 11, \u201cFinancial instruments and concentration of credit risks,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the company\u2019s derivative financial instruments.\nThe company has performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to these derivative financial instruments described above. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the analysis indicated that such market movements would have reduced the estimated fair value of these derivative financial instruments by approximately $44 million and $34 million, respectively. Based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate movements and the company\u2019s actual exposures and hedges, actual gains and losses in the future may differ from the above analysis.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe company has exposure to interest rate and market risk, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk. Its long-term debt is fixed rate and its short-term debt is variable rate. The company has used derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOur Terminix business is subject to a significant number of damage claims related to termite activity in homes for which we provide termite control services, often accompanied by a termite damage warranty. Our termite damage warranty is a differentiator in the industry that has enabled us to become the market leader of this product line. Damage claims include Non-litigated Claims and Litigated Claims. Recently we have experienced higher Non-Litigated Claims activity concentrated in the Mobile Bay Area of the United States related to Formosan termites, an invasive species, which has driven higher Non-Litigated Claims expense. In addition, since the beginning of 2017, we have been served with an increasing number of Litigated Claims, again primarily concentrated in the Mobile Bay Area and related to Formosan termite activity, which has driven higher Litigated Claim expense. Some plaintiffs have sought to demonstrate a pattern and practice of fraud in connection with Litigated Claims and have sought awards, in addition to repair costs, which included punitive damages and damages for mental anguish. We defend these Litigated Claims vigorously, and we are taking decisive actions to mitigate increasing claims costs, however, we cannot give assurance that these mitigation actions will be effective in reducing claims or costs related thereto, nor can we give assurance that lawsuits or other proceedings related to termite damage claims will not materially affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 16, 2016, the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Justice filed a civil complaint in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands related to a fumigation incident in a matter styled Government of the United States Virgin Islands v.

These proceedings include insured and uninsured matters that are brought on an individual, collective, representative and class action basis, or other proceedings involving regulatory, employment, general and commercial liability, automobile liability, wage and hour, environmental and other matters. We have entered into settlement agreements in certain cases, including with respect to putative collective and class actions, which are subject to court or other approvals. If one or more of our settlements are not finally approved, we could have additional or different exposure, which could be material. Subject to the paragraphs above, we do not expect any of these proceedings to have a material effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, we can give no assurance that the results of any such proceedings will not materially affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nTo minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates, the Bank manages its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by the Asset Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d). The ALCO, which is comprised of senior officers, has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset/liability management policies. Interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates. The ALCO, on an ongoing basis, monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies. Management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk.\nThe Company utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity. It then evaluates potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income. The model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both 100 and 200 basis points that are sustained for one year. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from the model\u2019s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies.\nGiven an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the base net interest income would decrease by an estimated 2.3% at December 31, 2019 compared with an increase of 2.0% at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios for the year ended December 31, 2019, as calculated using the static shock model approach:\nImplementation of strategies to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates in the future, could lessen our forecasted \u201cbase case\u201d net interest income in the event of no interest rate changes. Interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors. These factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as their relative pricing schedules. It is also influenced by market interest rates, deposit growth, loan growth, deposit decay rates and asset prepayment speed assumptions.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2019, which management anticipates, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. The projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments, as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals. While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, management cannot provide assurance that assumed repricing rates will approximate actual future activity.\nThe one-year cumulative gap position as of December 31, 2019 was negative $184.6 million or 14.8% of total assets. This is a one-day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of the Company\u2019s position at any other time. Any gap analysis has inherent shortcomings because certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A. provides a summary of the Bank's management of its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nFor fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates will generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates.\nOur current investment policy with respect to our cash and cash equivalents focuses on maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity. Although we continually evaluate our placement of investments, our cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of prime money market funds. The funds provide daily liquidity and may be subject to interest rate risk and fall in value if market interest rates increase. We do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location\u2019s functional currency.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenues were $1,661.7 million, of which approximately $119.8 million in revenue was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We believe constant currency and constant currency growth rate enhance the comparison of our financial performance from period-to-period, and to that of our competitors. Constant currency revenue excludes the impact from foreign currency fluctuations, which was favorable $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, net of any hedging effect recognized in the current period. Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the change in current period constant currency revenues over prior period revenues.\nThe major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Euro and the Chinese Yuan.

Such claims may not be covered by its insurance coverage, and even if they are, if claims against us are successful, they may exceed the limits of applicable insurance coverage.\nOn September 21, 2018, ATSCO, Inc., filed a complaint with the Superior Court seeking payment of $809,520 plus legal costs for disputed invoices to the Company dated from 2015 to June 30, 2018. The Company had entered into a Services and Material Supply Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d), dated March 4, 2016 for ATSCO to supply porcine and bovine tissue. The Company is disputing the amount owed and that the Agreement called for a fixed monthly fee regardless of whether tissue was delivered to the Company. On January 18, 2019, the Orange County Superior Court granted a Right to Attach Order and Order for Issuance of Writ of Attachment in the amount of $810,055. We contend at least $188,000 of the ATSCO claim relates to a wholly separate company, and over $500,000 of the claim is attributable to invoices sent without delivery of any tissue to the Company. The Company also believes it has numerous defenses and rights of setoff including without limitation: that ATSCO had an obligation to mitigate claimed damages, particularly when they were not delivering tissues; $188,000 of the amount that ATSCO is seeking are for invoices to Hancock Jaffe Laboratory Aesthetics, Inc.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices as discussed below. We have no exposure to interest rate risk as we had no amount outstanding on our variable interest loan at the end of our 2019 fiscal year and we have no exposure to foreign currency risk as all of our business is conducted in U.S. Dollars. We use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk. We use cash, futures and option contracts to hedge changes to the commodity prices of corn, natural gas and ethanol. We do not enter into these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe seek to minimize the risks from fluctuations in the prices of raw material inputs, such as corn and natural gas, and finished products, such as ethanol and distiller grains, through the use of hedging instruments. In practice, as markets move, we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate. Although we believe our hedge positions accomplish an economic hedge against our future purchases and sales, management has chosen not to use hedge accounting, which would match the gain or loss on our hedge positions to the specific commodity purchase being hedged. We are using fair value accounting for our hedge positions, which means as the current market price of our hedge positions changes, the realized or unrealized gains and losses are immediately recognized in our cost of goods sold or as an offset to revenues. The immediate recognition of hedging gains and losses under fair value accounting can cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged.\nAs of October 31, 2019, we had price protection in place for approximately 22% of our anticipated corn needs, approximately 77% of our natural gas needs and 11% of our ethanol sales for the next 12 months. We also had price protection in place for approximately 12% of our anticipated natural gas needs for a period from 13-24 months from October 31, 2019.\nA sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate our exposure to ethanol, corn and natural gas price risk. Market risk related to these factors is estimated as the potential change in income resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the average cost of our corn and natural gas prices and average ethanol price as of October 31, 2019, net of the forward and future\ncontracts used to hedge our market risk for corn and natural gas usage requirements. The volumes are based on our expected use and sale of these commodities for a one year period from October 31, 2019. The results of this analysis, which may differ from actual results, are as follows:\nFor comparison purposes, our sensitivity analysis for our 2018 fiscal year is set forth below.\nLiability Risk\nWe participate, along with other plants in the industry, in a group captive insurance company (Captive). The Captive insures losses related to workman's compensation, commercial property and general liability. The Captive reinsures catastrophic losses for all participants, including the Company, in excess of predetermined amounts. Our premiums are accrued by a charge to income for the period to which the premium relates and is remitted by our insurer to the captive reinsurer. These premiums are structured such that we have made a prepaid collateral deposit estimated for losses related to the above coverage. The Captive insurer has estimated and collected an amount in excess of the estimated losses but less than the catastrophic loss limit insured by the Captive. We cannot be assessed over the amount in the collateral fund.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk associated with commodity prices that the company is exposed to.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk.\nValuation Risk\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 100.0% of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates.\nBased on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2019, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments) assuming each floating rate investment is subject to 3-month LIBOR and there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:\nWe may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments.\nCurrency Risk\nFrom time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. We also have the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies under our credit facilities. Instead of entering into a foreign currency forward contract in connection with loans or other investments we have made that are denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan or investment. To the extent the loan or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our credit facilities, we may seek to utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (in thousands, except per share data)\nOur primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt which has not been effectively hedged with interest swaps or interest rate caps. As of December 31, 2019, we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate borrowings under our Credit Facility, Second Term and Third Term Loans and certain variable rate mortgages and notes payable. As of December 31, 2019, we had total variable rate debt outstanding of $152,548 with a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%. The effect of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019 would be an increase or decrease in our interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 of $1,475.\nOur interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for a portion of our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. We have also entered into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps, and in the future may enter into treasury options or locks, to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2019, we have an interest rate cap related to debt on the Annapolis Waterfront Hotel, Annapolis, MD; and we have ten interest rate swap contracts related to debt on Hilton Garden Inn, 52nd Street, New York, NY; Courtyard, LA Westside, Culver City, CA; Hyatt Union Square, New York, NY; Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca, New York, NY; and our unsecured credit facility. We do not intend to enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2019 approximately 89% of our outstanding consolidated long-term indebtedness is subject to fixed rates or effectively capped, while 11% of our outstanding long term indebtedness is subject to floating rates, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nChanges in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the debt, but such changes have no impact on interest expense incurred. If interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our debt to decrease. The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2019 levels, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause the fair value of our fixed-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 to be approximately $1,067,168 and a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would cause the fair value of our fixed-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 to be approximately $1,130,237.\nWe regularly review interest rate exposure on our outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations. For debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2019, the following table presents expected principal repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates:\nThe table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2019, and does not consider exposure or positions that could arise after that date.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate and foreign currency risks as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $334.5 million and marketable securities of $184.0 million which consisted primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate notes and bonds. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity without significantly increasing risk. Our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue, issuer, or type of investment.\nTo date, we have not been exposed, nor do we anticipate being exposed, to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Currency Risk\nTo date, all of our inventory purchases have been denominated in U.S. dollars. Our international sales are primarily denominated in foreign currencies and any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the currencies in which we conduct sales in foreign countries could have an adverse impact on our revenue. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, our suppliers incur many costs, including labor costs, in other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our gross margins. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, we believe that the exposure to foreign currency fluctuation from revenue and operating expenses is relatively small at this time as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total expenses.\nTo partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses, we have in the past entered into cash flow hedges in the form of foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. However, there were no such cash flow hedges entered into during 2019. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged.\nWe had no outstanding contracts in cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue and expense transactions as of December 31, 2019. We had outstanding balance sheet hedges with a total notional amount of $83.4 million as of December 31, 2019. We assessed our exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations.

Lafleur, seeking a determination as to the ownership of 438,115 shares of our stock option shares previously granted to him. The trial in this matter began on May 5, 2000. On June 2, 2000, the court entered a Stipulated Statement of Decision holding that Thomas R. Lafleur became fully vested in ownership of the 438,115 shares of Common Stock in question on June 5, 1998. On June 3, 2000, we entered into an Agreement of Settlement and Compromise, pursuant to which the Lafleurs agreed to release and dismiss, with prejudice, all of their claims against us and we agreed to deliver 438,115 shares of treasury stock and to make a cash payment of $8.8 million to the Lafleurs. In addition, we incurred legal fees relating to this litigation totaling $3.1 million. We have filed claims with our insurance carriers seeking reimbursement for litigation and legal fees relating to this case. As of December 31, 2000, we had received $15.0 million, subject to a reservation of right by the insurers. Furthermore, on November 14, 2000, Reliance Insurance Company (Reliance) filed a legal action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego seeking declaratory relief and restitution for the $5.0 million of insurance payments made by Reliance in connection with the Lafleur litigation.

We denied that it infringes any legitimate trademark rights of i2 Technologies, in part on the grounds that we have priority in the Rhythms name with respect to the goods and services provided by us and that our use of those marks is not likely to cause confusion among the consumers of our services, and the services provided by i2 Technologies, respectively. On February 12, 2001, Rhythms and i2 agreed to dismiss their claims with prejudice, except for Rhythm's claim for cancellation of certain i2 marks, which claim was dismissed without prejudice.\nGuild Litigation - Guild Colorado, LLC (Guild) filed an action in the Texas State Court for Dallas County alleging that we breached a construction contract. We intend to vigorously defend these claims and file counterclaims as appropriate.\nLacy Litigation - On January 22, 2001, John Lacy, a former Rhythms' employee, filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado alleging breach of contract and demanding relief in the amount of $1.3 million. We intend to vigorously defend against this claim.\nIn addition, we are subject to state commission, FCC and court decisions as they relate to the interpretation and implementation of the 1996 Act, the interpretation of CLEC interconnection agreements in general and our interconnection agreements in particular.

We conduct all of our operations through subsidiaries, which are engaged predominantly in the business of waste and energy services.\nOur mission is to provide sustainable waste and energy solutions. We seek to do this through a variety of service offerings, including our core business of owning and operating infrastructure for the conversion of waste to energy (known as \u201cenergy-from-waste\u201d or \u201cEfW\u201d).\nEfW facilities produce energy through the combustion of non-hazardous municipal solid waste (\u201cMSW\u201d) in specially-designed power plants. Most of our facilities are \u201cmass-burn\u201d facilities, which combust the MSW on an as-received basis without any pre-processing such as shredding, sorting or sizing. The process reduces the waste to an inert ash while extracting ferrous and non-ferrous metals for recycling. In addition to our mass-burn facilities, we own and/or operate additional facilities that use other processes or technologies, such as refuse-derived fuel facilities which process waste prior to combustion.\nEfW serves two key markets as both a sustainable waste management solution that is environmentally superior to landfilling and as a source of clean energy that reduces overall greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. EfW is considered renewable under the laws of many states and under federal law. Our facilities are critical infrastructure assets that allow our customers, which are principally municipal entities, to provide an essential public service through sustainable practices.\nOur EfW facilities earn revenue from the disposal of waste, generally under long-term contracts, the generation of electricity, and from the sale of metals recovered during the EfW process. We operate and/or have ownership positions in 41 EfW facilities, the majority of which are in North America. In total, these facilities process approximately 21 million tons of solid waste annually, equivalent to 9% of the post-recycled MSW generated in the United States. Our facilities produce approximately 10 million megawatt hours (\u201cMWh\u201d) of baseload electricity annually. We also operate waste management infrastructure, including 14 waste transfer stations, 20 material processing facilities, four landfills (primarily for ash disposal), one metals processing facility, and one ash processing facility (currently in start-up and testing phase), all of which are complementary to our core EfW business.\nOutside of North America, we operate and/or have equity interests in EfW projects in Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and China (our projects in the United Kingdom and China are currently in development and/or under construction). We intend to pursue additional international EfW projects where the regulatory and market environments are attractive. For additional information see Execution on Strategy below, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 3. New Business and Asset Management. Ownership and operation of facilities in foreign countries potentially involves greater political and financial uncertainties than we experience in the United States, as described below and discussed in Item 1A.", "summary": "Risk Factors.\n\nCovanta Holding Corporation is a holding company that operates through subsidiaries in the business of waste and energy services.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur primary areas of market risk include changes in: (1) the price of coal, which is the key raw material for our cokemaking business; (2) interest rates; and (3) foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes.\nPrice of coal\nWe did not use derivatives to hedge any of our coal purchases or sales. Although we have not previously done so, we may enter into derivative financial instruments from time to time in the future to economically manage our exposure related to these market risks.\nFor our Domestic Coke segment, the largest component of the price of our coke is coal cost. However, under the coke sales agreements at all of our Domestic Coke cokemaking facilities, coal costs are a pass-through component of the coke price, provided that we are able to realize certain targeted coal-to-coke yields. As such, when targeted coal-to-coke yields are achieved, the price of coal is not a significant determining factor in the profitability of these facilities. The coal component of the Jewell coke price is based on the weighted-average contract price of third-party coal purchases at our Haverhill facility applicable to AM USA coke sales. Therefore, we are subject to market risk to the extent the cost to procure coal at Jewell differs from the amount allowable to be passed through to our customer based on Haverhill's coal price.\nThe provisions of our coke sales agreements require us to meet minimum production levels and generally require us to secure replacement coke supplies at the prevailing market price if we do not meet contractual minimum volumes. Because market prices for coke are generally highly correlated to market prices for metallurgical coal, to the extent any of our facilities are unable to produce their contractual minimum volumes, we are subject to market risk related to the procurement of replacement supplies.\nInterest rates\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowing activities with variable interest rates and interest earned on our cash balances. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the daily average outstanding balance on borrowings with variable interest rates was $152.1 million and $172.5 million, respectively. Assuming a 50 basis point change in LIBOR, interest expense would have been impacted by $0.8 million and $0.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings with variable interest rates of $143.3 million under the Revolving Facility.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $97.1 million and $145.7 million, respectively, which accrue interest at various rates. Assuming a 50 basis point change in the rate of interest associated with our cash and cash equivalents, interest income would have been impacted by $0.6 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nForeign currency\nBecause we operate outside the U.S., we are subject to risk resulting from changes in the Brazilian real currency exchange rates. The currency exchange rates are influenced by a variety of economic factors including local inflation, growth, interest rates and governmental actions, as well as other factors. Revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the period and balance sheet accounts are translated at period-end exchange rates. Balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. If the currency exchange rates had changed by 10 percent, we estimate the impact to our net income in both 2019 and 2018 would have been approximately $0.4 million.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur market risk exposure on financial instruments includes interest rate risk on our bank credit facility, term loans and interest rate swap agreements and forward starting interest rate swap agreements. We are exposed to interest rate volatility on existing variable rate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates. We use interest rate swaps and forward starting swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances, respectively. All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading purposes. We do not attempt to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk for our cash equivalents.\nThe interest rates applied to borrowings under our credit facility adjust often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates. We do not attempt to mitigate the effects of short-term interest rate fluctuations on our credit facility borrowings through the use of derivative financial instruments. There were no borrowings under our credit facility at December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had seven interest rate swaps associated with $403.5 million of term loan debt. We use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated refinancing of existing term loan debt, and we had forward starting interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with an aggregated notional amount of $607.5 million associated with anticipated future refinancing of term loan debt maturing December 2021 through January 2029.

Terracom believes Jonathan and Jerry are in violation of their non-compete agreements by working for us and True Wireless, Inc. Oklahoma and TN do not adhere to non-competes and are not usually successful when in court, as such we believe it has a strong case against Terracom. The matter is entering the discovery process. Both Jerry Carroll and Jonathan Coffman are no longer working for True Wireless in sales. Carroll is no longer employed by the Company or any of its affiliates and Coffman works for SurgePays, Inc., but not in sales of wireless. The complaint requests general damages plus fees and costs for tortious interference with a business relationship in their prayer for relief. They have made no written demand for damages at this point in time. This matter is simply an anti-competitive attempt by Terracom to cause distress to True Wireless.\n3.

As of June 30, 2019, we had $296.5 million available for borrowing under our Revolver, subject to certain conditions.\nBased on current market interest rates for debt of similar terms and average maturities and based on recent transactions, we estimate the fair value of our Notes to be $4,067.7 million as of June 30, 2019. Our 2023 Unsecured Notes, 2025 Unsecured Notes, and 2027 Unsecured Notes accrue interest at fixed rates of 6.00%, 6.375%, and 5.75% respectively.\nBoth our Revolver and our Term Loan Facility accrue interest at floating rates subject to certain conditions. Our Term Loan Facility accrues interest at variable rates based upon the one month, three month or nine month LIBOR plus i) a spread of 2.0% on our $500.0 million tranche (which has a LIBOR floor of 0.0%) and ii) a spread of 2.25% on our B-2 Term Loan tranche (which has a LIBOR floor of 1.00%). Our Revolver accrues interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75% depending on our leverage ratio. As of June 30, 2019, the weighted average interest rates (including margin) on the Term Loan Facility and our Revolver were approximately 4.6% and 4.2%, respectively. A hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rate on our Term Loan Facility and Revolver of one percentage point would increase our annualized interest expense on the Term Loan Facility and Revolver by approximately 21% or $19.0 million, based on the applicable interest rate as of June 30, 2019. Historically, this impact\nwas limited as a result of the applicable interest rate being below the minimum 1.0% LIBOR floor on our Term Loan Facility tranche that matures on January 19, 2024.\nWe are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates if it is necessary to seek additional funding to support the expansion of our business and to support acquisitions.

In addition, government agencies and self-regulatory organizations in countries in which we conduct business conduct periodic examinations and may initiate administrative proceedings regarding the Company\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, or its directors, officers or employees. It is our policy to cooperate fully with such governmental requests, examinations and administrative proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of determining whether any loss in connection with any such matters is probable and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, we cannot estimate the amount of such loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, we believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that we are not currently party to any material pending proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, the resolution of which would have a material effect on the Company.\nIn June 2017, an action was filed in New York state court against defendants PJT Partners Inc., Park Hill Group LLC and Andrew W.W. Caspersen, arising out of the fraudulent conduct of Caspersen. PJT Partners Inc. and Park Hill Group LLC moved to dismiss the complaint on August 24, 2017. On August 13, 2018, the court dismissed all of the claims asserted against PJT Partners Inc. and Park Hill Group LLC, except for the fraud-based apparent authority claim. Plaintiffs and PJT Partners Inc. and Park Hill Group LLC appealed the court\u2019s August 2018 decision. On December 3, 2019, the appellate court dismissed the complaint in its entirety as against PJT Partners Inc. and Park Hill Group LLC. On January 2, 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion with the appellate court seeking reargument or, alternatively, leave to appeal, which we believe is without merit. We will continue to vigorously defend this action.\nOn June 16, 2009, Plaintiffs Frank Foy and Suzanne Foy, purportedly as qui tam plaintiffs on behalf of the State of New Mexico, filed a case in New Mexico state court against Park Hill Group LLC and one of its officers, as well as The Blackstone Group L.P. (together, \u201cPark Hill Defendants\u201d), in addition to dozens of other named and unnamed defendants, alleging violations of New Mexico\u2019s Fraud Against Taxpayers Act (\u201cFATA\u201d) in an action styled Foy v. Austin Capital Management, Ltd., et al., Case No. D-101-CV-2009-01189 (N.M. Dist. Ct.). The complaint alleged, among other things, that the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board and the New Mexico State Investment Council made investments that were influenced by kickbacks and other inducements. In the complaint, the Park Hill Defendants were grouped together with other defendants who were all alleged generically to have conspired to defraud the State of New Mexico. On November 30, 2015, after several years of motion practice, including an earlier decision by the New Mexico Supreme Court to consolidate this case with another case by the same plaintiffs (in which the Park Hill Defendants were not parties), the New Mexico Attorney General filed a motion on behalf of the State of New Mexico seeking wholesale dismissal of these proceedings. On June 6, 2017, the court granted the motion to dismiss brought on behalf of the State of New Mexico, the effect of which dismissed the action against the Park Hill Defendants.

To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nUnder our Credit Facility, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings. Borrowings under the Credit Facility, if denominated in U.S. Dollars, are subject to rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus a spread based on leverage or a base rate plus a spread based on leverage. The base rate is the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, and (c) LIBOR for an Interest Period of one month plus 1%. Borrowings under the Credit Facility, if denominated in Canadian Dollars, are subject to rates based on LIBOR plus a spread based on leverage or a base rate plus a spread based on leverage. The base rate for these purposes is the highest of (a) the Canadian Prime Rate and (b) the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate (\"CDOR Rate\") for an interest period of one month plus 1%. As of December 29, 2019, we had $206 million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates. A 1.0% change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre-tax interest expense fluctuation of $2.1 million on an annualized basis.\nLIBOR is set to terminate in December 2021, however, we anticipate an amended credit agreement will be executed at the new applicable interest rate. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing the U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities. However, there is no definitive information regarding the future use of LIBOR, any particular replace rate, or the market acceptance of any potential change. Any such change may have an adverse effect on the cost of our borrowings.\nWe continue to monitor our interest rate risk on an ongoing basis and may use interest rate swaps or similar instruments in the future to manage our exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings as the Company deems appropriate.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nDuring 2019, we operated as many as 18 restaurants in Canada, and the Canadian Dollar is the functional currency for our Canadian restaurant operations. We have currency risk related to transactions denominated in Canadian Dollars and the translation of our Canadian restaurants\u2019 financial results into U.S. Dollars.\nDue to the immateriality of our Canadian restaurant operations during the year and the refranchising or closure of all Canadian restaurants during the fourth quarter of 2019, our foreign currency risk is limited at this date. As a result, the Company has not entered into any foreign currency exchange rate contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities expected to be settled at a future date.\nCommodity Price Risks\nThe Company\u2019s restaurant menus are highly dependent upon a few select commodities, including ground beef, steak fries, poultry, and produce. We may or may not have the ability to increase menu prices, or vary menu items, in response to food commodity price increases. A 1.0% increase in food costs would negatively impact cost of sales by approximately $3 million on an annualized basis.\nMany of the food products we purchase are affected by changes in weather, production, availability, seasonality, and other factors outside our control. In an effort to mitigate some of this risk, we have entered into fixed price agreements on some of our food and beverage products, including certain proteins, produce, and cooking oil. As of December 29, 2019, approximately 60% of our estimated annual food and beverage purchases were covered by fixed price contracts, most of which are scheduled to expire at various times through the end of 2021. These contracts may exclude related expenses such as fuel surcharges and other fees. In addition, we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources, which helps to reduce or mitigate these risks.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Summary: The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nCurrency Risks\nTransaction Exposure and Revaluation Effects\nTransaction exposure arises because the cost of a product originates in one currency and the product is sold in another currency. Revaluation effects come from valuation of assets denominated in other currencies than the reporting currency of each unit.\nThe Company\u2019s gross transaction exposure for 2019 was approximately $1.0 billion. A part of the currency flows had counter-flows in the same currency pair, which reduced the net exposure to approximately $0.9 billion. The largest net transaction exposures were the sale of Euro against U.S. Dollars and the purchase of U.S. Dollar against Korean Won. The five largest currency pairs accounted for approximately 82% of the Company\u2019s net currency transaction exposure.\nSince the Company can only effectively hedge these currency flows in the short term, periodic hedging would only reduce the impact of fluctuations temporarily. Over time, periodic hedging would postpone but not reduce the impact of fluctuations. In addition, the net exposure is limited to approximately one quarter of net sales and is made up of close to 20 different currency pairs with exposures of more than $1 million each. Veoneer generally does not hedge these flows. However, for some purchased components from external suppliers, the Company may enter into hedging from time to time. There were no foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nTranslation Exposure in the Statement of Operations and Balance Sheet\nThe Company estimates that a 1% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar versus European currencies would decrease reported U.S. dollar annual net sales in 2019 by $6 million or by 0.3% while it would have a positive impact on the operating loss for 2019 by approximately 0.4% or by about $2 million, assuming reported corporate average margin.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $859 million (excludes $35 million in Assets held for Sales). As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates that a 1% change of the interest rates would not significantly impact our interest expense or income.\nComponent Costs\nVeoneer procures raw material and components from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain mechanical components and material in the region in which our products are manufactured to limit transportation, currency risks and other costs. The most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products are various electrical components, non-ferrous metals and ferrous metals for brake systems. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials more than those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules. Despite this, material price changes in Veoneer\u2019s supply chain could have a significant impact on its profitability.\nChanges in most raw material prices affect the Company with a time lag. For non-ferrous metals like aluminum and zinc, we have quarterly and sometimes monthly price adjustments.\nThe Company\u2019s strategies to offset price increases on cost of materials include working with suppliers to mitigate costs, seeking alternative product designs and material specifications, combining purchase requirements with our customers and/or suppliers, changing suppliers, and other means. However, should these actions not be sufficient to offset component price increases, our earnings could be materially impacted.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

For our floating-rate debt, interest rate changes generally impact our earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant.\nOn April 24, 2015, we entered into two interest rate cap contracts which were designated as cash flow hedges. These interest rate cap contracts have an aggregate notional principal amount of $800.0 million, cap rates of 1.0%, and mature on May 31, 2019.\nOn December 17, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap contract, which was designated as a cash flow hedge.

It has a notional principal amount of $450.0 million, a swap rate of 2.72%, and matures on December 29, 2023.\nOn November 2, 2018, we completed the repricing of our Term Loan Facility, which among other things, reduced the interest rate margins applicable to our Term Loan Facility from 1.50% to 1.00%, in the case of prime rate loans, and from 2.50% to 2.00%, in the case of LIBOR loans, with the LIBOR floor being reduced from 0.75% to 0.00%.\nWe have exposure to changes in interest rates on our Term Loan Facility above the 1.00% rate under our interest rate cap contracts. In addition, we have unlimited interest rate risk related to borrowings on our variable rate debt in excess of the notional principal amount of our interest rate cap contracts.\nAt February 2, 2019, we had $961.4 million of floating-rate debt, exclusive of original issue discount. Based on $961.4 million outstanding as floating-rate debt, a one percentage point increase as of February 2, 2019 (after considering our 1.0% interest rate cap contracts), would cause an increase to cash interest expense of $4.0 million per year, resulting in $4.0 million less in our pre-tax earnings.

In the normal course of business, the company may be exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. The company limits its exposure to core market risks by following established risk management policies and procedures and through the use of match-funding from IBM and third parties. Although the company seeks to substantially match-fund the terms, currency and interest rate variability of its debt against its underlying financing assets, risks may arise from a mismatch between assets and the related liabilities used for funding. The company may also choose to mitigate any remaining exposure relating to interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations through the use of interest rate or foreign currency derivatives.\nIn addition, the company performs a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposure may have on the fair values of the company\u2019s debt and other financial instruments.\nThe financial instruments that are included in the sensitivity analysis are comprised of the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term and long-term loans, installment payment receivables, participated interests in IBM financing receivables, Commercial Financing receivables, and purchased interest in certain of IBM\u2019s trade and other receivables, investments, short- and long-term debt and derivative financial instruments. The company\u2019s derivative financial instruments generally include interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts.\nTo perform the sensitivity analysis, the company assesses the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the fair values of market-sensitive instruments.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn January 11, 2019, the Company received notice that Strongbow Advisors, Inc., and Robert Stevens had been appointed by the Nevada District Court, as Receiver for the Registrant in Case No. A-18-784952-C.\nThe company sought the appointment of the Receiver after it found itself in an imminent danger of insolvency following the issuance by an arbitration panel of an award in the sum of $3,994,522.5 million in favor of Cromogen Biotechnology Corporation in the matter entitled Cromogen Biotechnology Corporation vs. Earth Science Tech, Inc.\nThe Award consisted a sum for breach of contract against the Company in the amount of $120,265, a sum for costs and fees against the Company in the amount of $111,057 and a sum for the claim of tortuous interference and conversion against the Company in the amount of $3,763,200. The District Court in Florida had confirmed the Award granted by the arbitration panel, denying however, the award of fees that the arbitration panel had granted Cromogen.\nThe Cromogen Litigation is now on appeal and the Company is optimistic about its prospects on appeal. Nevertheless, the outcome remains speculative and so notwithstanding its prospects for success on appeal, and faced with such a large judgment and the imminent danger of insolvency, the Company determined that it was in the best interest of its shareholders and creditors to seek protection under receivership and the appointment of a receiver. As of the date of this prospectus, the Company remains in imminent danger of insolvency as the outcome of the Cromogen Litigation remains speculative.\nAs part of the impact of the receivership, the Court issued a Writ of Injunction or \u201cBlanket Stay\u201d covering the Company and its assets during the time that the Company is in receivership. As a result of the \u201cBlanket Stay\u201d the Company\u2019s estate is protected from creditors and interference with its administration is prevented while the Company\u2019s financial issues are being fully analyzed and resolved. As part of this process, creditors will be notified and required to provide claims in writing under oath on or before the deadline stated in the notice provided by the Receiver or those claims will be barred under NRS \u00a778.675. The Blanket Stay will remain in place unless otherwise waived by the Receiver, or it is vacated by the Court or alternatively, lifted by the Court, upon a \u201cmotion to lift stay\u201d duly made and approved by the Nevada District Court.\nThe appointment of the Receiver was approved unanimously by the Board and by a majority of the Company\u2019s shareholders. Strongbow and Stevens were selected because of their reputation in helping (i) companies restructure and (ii) to execute on their business plans, albeit under a debt and capital structure that allows them to succeed. Stevens and Strongbow assist companies by helping them raise the capital needed not only to pay debts, but build and grow their businesses. The Receiver, however, is an agent of the court, and will be independent and neutral in managing the Company\u2019s operations and trying to preserve the Company\u2019s value for the creditors and shareholders.\nThere are a number of possible outcomes to the receivership, including settlement and payment to creditors, reorganization, or liquidation. The intent of the Receiver is to reorganize the Company, pay or settle the Company\u2019s debts and emerge from receivership. If the Receiver is not successful in mitigating the Company\u2019s liabilities, the Company\u2019s results could be materially adversely impacted and the Company may be forced to liquidate its business.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nEarth Science Tech, Inc. received notice on January 11, 2019 that Strongbow Advisors, Inc. and Robert Stevens had been appointed by the Nevada District Court as Receiver for the Company in Case No. A-18-784952-C.

These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our financial results in any particular interim reporting period. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.\nAlthough we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, U.S. GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. We follow a process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\nWe include various types of indemnification clauses in our agreements. These indemnifications may include, but are not limited to, infringement claims related to our intellectual property, direct damages and consequential damages. The type and amount of such indemnifications vary substantially based on our assessment of risk and reward associated with each agreement. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification clauses is minimal, and we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions. We have no liabilities recorded for these clauses as of December 31, 2019.\nOn March 14, 2017, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, captioned StrikeForce Technologies, Inc. v.

On May 8, 2017, the Company answered the complaint denying the allegations of patent infringement. The parties then engaged in motion practice and discovery in the case. The plaintiff has also brought suit against various other companies in the cybersecurity industry. In one such suit in the federal district court for the Central District of California, on December 1, 2017, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding that the StrikeForce asserted claims are invalid. StrikeForce appealed such decision. In light of such ruling, on December 20, 2017, the court in the Company\u2019s case granted a stay of the proceedings pending the appeal in the related case. On April 16, 2019, the Court dismissed the claims of StrikeForce against us with prejudice. We consider this case to be closed.\nFrom time to time, we have been involved in the litigation incidental to the conduct of our business.

On or about April 1, 1999, the Company commenced a proceeding against Rubbermaid with the American Arbitration Association. The Company has alleged causes of action for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and deceit, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, constructive fraud, and money had and received. The Company's claims arise from Rubbermaid's failure to perform its obligations as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement. The Company seeks damages in excess of $5,000,000 as a result of Rubbermaid's wrongful acts. The Company is proceeding with the prosecution of its claims in arbitration.\nOn July 19, 1999, Rubbermaid filed a \"counterclaim\" against the Company in connection with the parties' rights and obligation under the Transition Services Agreement. Rubbermaid claims an entitlement to an amount in excess of $1,280,000 as a result of services it allegedly performed and/or payments it allegedly made in connection with the Transition Services Agreement. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend itself against these claims, which it believes to be unfounded.\nThe date of the arbitration hearing with respect to the above matter is August 28, 2000.\nOn September 16, 1999, the Company commenced a legal action against Rubbermaid in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In the action, the Company has alleged causes of action for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company claims that Rubbermaid fraudulently induced Decora into acquiring Rubbermaid's Decorative Coverings Group by means of certain material misrepresentations, including misrepresentations with respect to the status of certain of the Decorative Covering Group's major customer accounts. The Company seeks damages in excess of $14,000,000 as a result of Rubbermaid's wrongful acts. In response, Rubbermaid generally has denied the allegations in the Company's complaint but has not asserted any affirmative claims, such as a cross-complaint, against the Company, except that in its prayer for relief, Rubbermaid requests that it be awarded costs and attorney's fees to which it may be entitled under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement if it were the prevailing party in the action. The parties have stipulated and the federal court has ordered that the claims asserted in the federal action are to be arbitrated and that the arbitration is to commence no later than August 28, 2000.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in pending actions which, in the opinion of management of the Company, are not material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and overall economic conditions. Our market risks include interest rate risk and fuel price risk. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur debt exposes us to risk of fluctuations in interest rates. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates. We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position. During fiscal year 2017, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to limit our exposure to variable interest rate terms on certain borrowings under our Initial Term Loan Facility. The risks from interest rate swaps include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties.\nAfter considering interest rate swaps that fixed the interest rate on $733 million of the principal amounts of our Initial Term Loan Facility, approximately 65% of the principal amount of our debt bore interest at floating rates based on LIBOR or an alternative base rate, as defined in our credit agreements, as of December 28, 2019. A hypothetical 1% change in the applicable rate would cause the interest expense on our floating rate debt to change by approximately $31 million per year (see Note 13, Debt, in our consolidated financial statements). As was announced in July 2017, the use of LIBOR is intended to be phased out by the end of 2021. We are unable to predict the impact of using alternative reference rates and corresponding rate risk as of this time.\nFuel Price Risk\nWe are also exposed to risk due to fluctuations in the price and availability of diesel fuel. We require significant quantities of diesel fuel for our vehicle fleet, and the price and supply of diesel fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. Increases in the cost of diesel fuel can negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending and increase the prices we pay for products, and the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers.\nOur activities to minimize fuel cost risk include route optimization, improving fleet utilization and using fuel surcharges. We also enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected diesel fuel requirements. We had diesel fuel forward purchase\ncommitments totaling $96 million through April 2021 as of December 28, 2019. These lock in approximately 50% of our projected diesel fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods. Our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price or hedged at a later date. Using current published market price projections for diesel and estimated fuel consumption needs, a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price could result in approximately $9 million in additional fuel cost on such uncommitted volumes through April 2021.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks faced by a company, including interest rate risk and fuel price risk.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We manage cash flow exposures for our major countries and the foreign currency impact of assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies using a combination of forward contracts. Principal currencies hedged are the Philippine Peso, Indian Rupee, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Chinese Yuan, Brazilian Real, and Colombian Peso. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nThe following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments as of November 30, 2019 and 2018, arising from an instantaneous strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar by 5%, 10% and 15% (in thousands).\nWe apply hedge accounting to our long-term forward contracts which would reduce the variability of cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. We serve many of our clients using service delivery centers in other geographies. As a result, the contracts with these clients are typically priced in one currency, while a substantial portion of the costs incurred to deliver services under these contracts are denominated in the local currency of the country where services are provided, which represents a foreign exchange exposure. The change in the value of these forward contracts would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues or cost when recognized.\nAll other foreign exchange contracts have typical maturities of twelve months or less and are executed to protect us against foreign currency exposure pertaining to receivables, payables and intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the respective entities. These contracts are marked-to-market and any material gains and\nTable of Content\nlosses on our hedge contracts resulting from a hypothetical, instantaneous change in the strength of the U.S. dollar would be significantly offset by mark-to-market gains and losses on the corresponding assets and liabilities being hedged.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt obligations which have floated relative to major interest rate benchmarks in the United States, Canada and Japan. We are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, changes in which affects the costs associated with hedging and interest paid on our debt.\nTo manage interest rate risk on the U.S. dollar-denominated floating-rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of $2.0 billion as of both November 30, 2019 and 2018, which effectively converted a portion of the floating rate debt to a fixed interest rate. Substantially, all of our interest rate swaps are accounted as cash flow hedges. A 15% variation in our interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our swaps.\nThe following tables present hypothetical interest expense related to our outstanding borrowings with variable interest rates (after considering the impact of the above mentioned swaps) for the years ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the respective countries\u2019 yield curves, of plus or minus 5%, 10% and 15% (in thousands).\nEquity Price Risk\nThe equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities as of November 30, 2019 and 2018 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Marketable equity securities include shares of common stock and are recorded at fair market value based on quoted market prices.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk. Many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control, contribute to interest rate risk.\nAs of December 31, 2019, after consideration of $400 million of interest rates swaps in effect, we had outstanding $617.0 million of consolidated indebtedness that bore interest at variable rates.\nWe monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 1% change in year-end interest rates. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase the interest expense on the $617.0 million of variable indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2019 by approximately $6.2 million annually. Conversely, a decrease in the LIBOR rate to 0.76% would decrease the interest expense on this $617.0 million of variable indebtedness outstanding by approximately $6.2 million annually based on the one month LIBOR rate of approximately 1.763% as of December 31, 2019.\nOn April 5, 2017, the Company entered into forward interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million. The forward swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on $400 million of term loan borrowings, $200 million of swaps allocated to Term Loan A and $200 million allocated to Term Loan B, from January 2, 2018 through December 17, 2021 and April 27, 2022, respectively, at approximately 3.2% assuming the current LIBOR spread of 1.2%.\nOn December 20, 2018, we entered into additional forward interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million. The forward swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on $400 million of term loan borrowings, $200 million of swaps allocated to Term Loan A and $200 million allocated to Term Loan B, from December 17, 2021 through December 17, 2023 and April 27, 2022 through April 27, 2024, respectively. The weighted average effective fixed interest rate on the $400 million notional amount of term loan financing following the commencement of these swap agreements will approximate 3.8%, commencing on December 17, 2021 and April 27, 2022, assuming the current LIBOR spread of 1.2%. On December 20, 2018, the Company entered into additional forward interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $200 million. The forward swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on $100 million of additional term loan borrowings from January 2, 2020 through December 17, 2023 as well as $100 million of additional term loan borrowings from January 2, 2020 through April 27, 2024. The weighted average effective fixed interest rate on the $200 million notional amount of term loan financing, following the execution of these swap agreements, will approximate 3.8% to 4.1%, commencing on January 2, 2020, assuming the current LIBOR spreads on the Company\u2019s term loans of 1.2% to 1.5%.\nThe above analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could impact interest rates or expected changes associated with future indebtedness. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change.

To achieve these objectives, from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars, swaps, caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to existing and prospective debt instruments. We generally do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $2,035.7 million principal amount of fixed rate debt outstanding, a $747.7 million increase as compared to December 31, 2018, excluding debt with a variable rate that is effectively fixed by related interest rate hedge contracts. The estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt was $2,107.1 million. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher, the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt would have been $125.7 million lower. If interest rates had been 100 basis points lower, the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt would have been $136.8 million higher.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $471.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding, a $61.0 million decrease as compared to December 31, 2018, not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. If the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher or lower, the annual interest expense at December 31, 2019 would increase or decrease by $4.7 million.\nSee \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.\"\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $50.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding with $50.0 million of related floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These swaps effectively fix the underlying one-month LIBOR rate at a weighted average rate of 1.693%. If the underlying LIBOR interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the aggregate fair market value of the swaps at December 31, 2019 would increase or decrease by $1.0 million.\nWe are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, which are major financial institutions, under the swaps. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our counterparties using publicly available information. Based on this review, we currently expect the counterparties to perform fully under the swaps. However, if a counterparty defaults on its obligations under a swap, we could be required to pay the full rates on the applicable debt, even if such rates were in excess of the rate in the contract.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThis text provides a summary of the market risk disclosures of a company.

{"section": "ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs of December 31, 2000, we have approximately $411.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and current, long-term and restricted investments. Of the investments, approximately $228.7 million is classified as available-for-sale investments and $21.2 million is classified as held-to-maturity investments. These investments are primarily in fixed income, investment grade securities. Our investment policy emphasizes return of principal and liquidity and is focused on fixed returns that limit volatility and risk of principal. Because of our investment policies, the primary market risk associated with our portfolio is interest rate risk.\nAssuming interest rates were to increase by a factor of 1.1, the net hypothetical loss in fair value of stockholders' equity related to financial instruments is estimated to be approximately $5.1 million after tax (5.6% of total stockholders' equity). We believe that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows, as it is unlikely that we would need or choose to substantially liquidate our investment portfolio.\nThe effect of interest rate risk on potential near-term net income, cash flow and fair value was determined based on commonly used interest rate sensitivity analyses. The models project the impact of interest rate changes on a wide range of factors, including duration and prepayment. Fair value was estimated based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates, assuming an immediate 10% increase in interest rates. Because duration is estimated, rather than a known quantity, for certain securities, other market factors may impact security valuations and there can be no assurance that our portfolio would perform in line with the estimated values.\nAs of December 31, 2000, we had $135 million in borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit facility. The average cost of borrowing on this credit facility for 2000, including the impact of the interest-rate swap agreements, was approximately 9.9%. If the average cost of borrowing on the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2000 were to increase by a factor of 1.1, annual income before tax would decrease by approximately $1.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2000, CII had convertible subordinated Debentures outstanding of $47,059,000, of which $18,000 were held by Sierra Health Services, Inc. and is eliminated on consolidation. Purchase activity for the Debentures, to parties other than CII or Sierra, is believed to be minimal and there is no known market quotation system for the Debentures. The fair value of the Debentures at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was estimated to be $23,530,000 and $35,601,000, respectively. The December 31, 2000 value is our best estimate and was based on $18,000 stated value Debentures that we purchased for $9,000 in September 2000 and may not be indicative of the actual market value since we are not aware of any other recent Debenture purchases or market quotes. The December 31, 1999 price is based on the estimated market price on December 31, 1999. If interest rates were to fluctuate by a factor of 1.1, we do not anticipate a material change in the fair value of the Debentures based on the current market for them.\nOur outstanding financing obligations related to the sale-leaseback transaction are not publicly traded and are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk associated with CII's investments, borrowings, and financing obligations.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Transactions involving these financial instruments are with creditworthy banks, primarily banks that are party to the Company's credit facilities (see Note 6 \u201cFinancing Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). The use of these instruments exposes the Company to market and credit risk which may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, although counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nInformation about the Company's foreign currency hedging activities is set forth in Note 18 \"Derivatives and Hedging\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s risk management procedure, a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values. The sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements\nof 10% in foreign currencies to which the Company was exposed at December 31, 2019 through its foreign currency forward contracts.\nThe estimated loss from the Company\u2019s foreign currency forward contracts, calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above, is $8.6 million at December 31, 2019. The Company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its foreign currency forward contracts would be partially offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.\nThe sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\nInterest Rate Fluctuations\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk from its credit facilities and long-term borrowing commitments. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities and long-term borrowing commitments accrue interest as described in Note 6 \u201cFinancing Arrangements\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. The Company's long-term borrowing commitments are subject to interest rate fluctuations, which could be material to the Company's cash flows and results of operations. In order to mitigate this risk, the Company enters into interest rate hedges as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Information about the Company's interest rate hedges is provided in Note 18 \"Derivatives and Hedging in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. In order to determine the impact of unfavorable changes in interest rates on the Company's cash flows and results of operations, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis as part of its risk management procedures.

This employee has claimed that these commissions could total $1.3 million. We have denied that we owe the employee such commissions and have further informed her that even if we did owe her commissions on the project, we are unable to adequately determine at the time of our response what, if any, gross profit, we have made on the LAUSD project. This employee filed suit on March 29, 2001 in the Los Angeles Superior Court in this matter. We are unable to determine what the outcome will be at this time. We believe that this claim and amount are without merit and intend to vigorously defend this action.\nAs part of our assignment of our rights and obligations under our contract with LAUSD to Pacific Bell/SBC Datacomm, Pacific Bell agreed to pay those subcontractors who had previously done work for us under the contract but remained unpaid. Pacific Bell intends to make these payments as these subcontractors complete unfinished or deficient work. Several of these subcontractors have filed suit for non-payment.

Following a non-jury trial, the court rendered a decision in favor of GMH and against Prudential and us, awarding GMH $20.3 million in compensatory damages, against Prudential and our Company jointly and severally, and $10.0 million in punitive damages, allocating the punitive damage award $7.0 million as against Prudential and $3.0 million as against our Company. Following the denial of motions by Prudential and us for a new trial, a judgment was entered on December 3, 1998. Prudential and our Company filed an appeal of the judgment. On March 3, 2000, the appellate court in Pennsylvania reversed all of the trial courts' decisions finding that liability was not supported on any theory claimed by GMH and directed that a judgment be entered in favor of the defendants including our Company. The plaintiff filed an appeal with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which was denied. The plaintiff has\nexhausted all appeal possibilities and judgment is expected to be entered shortly in favor of all defendants.\nIn August 1993, a former commissioned sales person of our Company filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Bergen County, alleging gender discrimination and wrongful termination by us. On November 20, 1996, a jury returned a verdict against our Company, awarding $1.5 million in general damages and $5.0 million in punitive damages to the plaintiff. Subsequently, the trial court awarded the plaintiff $0.6 million in attorneys' fees and costs. Following denial by the trial court of our Company's motions for a new trial, reversal of the verdict and reduction of damages, we filed an appeal of the verdict and requested a reduction of damages. On March 9, 1999 the appellate court ruled in our Company's favor, reversed the trial court decision and ordered a new trial. On February 16, 2000 the Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed the decision of the appellate court, concluded that the general damage award in the trial court should be sustained and returned the case to the appellate court for a determination as to whether a new trial should be ordered on the issue of punitive damages. In April 2000, we settled the compensatory damages claim, including interest, and all claims to date with respect to attorneys fees by paying to the plaintiff the sum of $2.75 million leaving only the punitive damage claim for resolution. The plaintiff also agreed, with very limited exceptions, that no matter what the outcome of the punitive damage claim our Company would not be responsible for more than 50% of the plaintiff's future attorney fees.

The plaintiff has named FiNet as a defendant alleging that FiNet assumed all of Coastal's debts and obligations when FiNet acquired Coastal in April 1998. The plaintiff seeks to recover actual damages in the amount of $1.7 million and premium rebates in the approximate amount of $26,000. The action was removed to the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division (\"Texas District Court\") on January 18, 2000. On May 31, 2000 the Texas District Court granted FiNet's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and dismissed the action without prejudice. Thereafter, FiNet and Coastal filed a declaratory relief action against First City in the San Francisco Superior Court with respect to the issues that had been raised by First City in the dismissed Texas action. First City removed the action to the United States District Court, Northern District of California (\"California District Court\"), and filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative to change venue to New York. At a hearing held on August 28, 2000, the California Court denied First City's motion to dismiss. First City answered the complaint and filed a \"cross-complaint\" which included allegations against Coastal and FiNet, as well as allegations against Coastal's three prior shareholders in their individual capacities (\"Individual Defendants\"). Subsequently, the California District Court on February 12, 2001 dismissed the Individual Defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction and ordered the remaining parties to mediation. A mediation conference is scheduled for April 26, 2001. FiNet intends to defend vigorously against the action and believes that the ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFiNet and certain subsidiaries are defendants in various other legal proceedings, which FiNet considers to be ordinary routine litigation incidental to FiNet's business.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign exchange, as discussed below.\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES\nAs an independent oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, other income and equity earnings and profitability, reserve values, access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil and condensate. Prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. Historically, prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable, and such volatility is expected to continue. This volatility is demonstrated by the average realizations in Venezuela, which declined from $10.01 per Bbl in 1997 to $6.75 per Bbl in 1998 and increased to $14.94 per Bbl in 2000. Based on our budgeted production and costs, we will require an average realization in Venezuela of approximately $12.50 per Bbl in 2001 in order to break-even on income from consolidated companies before our equity in earnings from affiliated companies. From time to time, we have utilized hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow, as well as to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations, but we have utilized no such transactions since 1996. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. Because gains or losses associated with hedging transactions are included in oil sales when the hedged production is delivered, such gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities. We did not enter into any commodity hedging agreements during 1999 or 2000.\nINTEREST RATES\nTotal long-term debt at December 31, 2000, consisted of $213 million of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes maturing in 2003 ($108 million) and 2007 ($105 million). A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have had a material affect on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE\nOur operations are located primarily outside of the United States. In particular, our current oil producing operations are located in Venezuela and Russia, countries which have had recent histories of significant inflation and devaluation. For the Venezuelan operations, oil sales are received under a contract in effect through 2012 in U.S. dollars; expenditures are both in U.S. dollars and local currency. For the Russian operations, a majority of the oil sales are received in U.S. dollars; expenditures are both in U.S. dollars and local currency, although a larger percentage of the expenditures are in local currency. We have utilized no currency hedging programs to mitigate any risks associated with operations in these countries, and therefore our financial results are subject to favorable or unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation in these countries.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks faced by an independent oil and natural gas producer.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nFrom time to time, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business. The Company, like HMOs and health insurers generally, excludes certain health care services from coverage under its HMO, PPO and other plans. The Company is, in the ordinary course of business, subject to the claims of its enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict treatment or reimbursement for certain services. The loss of even one such claim, if it results in a significant punitive damage award, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable settlements of coverage claims.\nIn June 2000, the California Medical Association filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in San Francisco against BCC. The lawsuit alleges that BCC violated the RICO Act through various misrepresentations to and inappropriate actions against health care providers. In late 1999, a number of class-action lawsuits were brought against several of the Company's competitors alleging, among other things, various misrepresentations regarding their health plans and breaches of fiduciary obligations to health plan members. In August 2000, the Company was added as a party to SHANE V. HUMANA, ET. AL., a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of health care providers nationwide. In addition to the RICO claims brought in the California Medical Association lawsuit, this lawsuit also alleges violations of ERISA, federal and state \"prompt pay\" regulations and certain common law claims. In October 2000, the federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order consolidating the California Medical Association lawsuit, the SHANE lawsuit and various other pending managed care class-action lawsuits against other companies before District Court Judge Federico Moreno in the Southern District of Florida for purposes of the pretrial proceedings. In March 2001, Judge Moreno dismissed the plaintiffs' claims based on violation of the RICO Act, although the dismissal was made without prejudice to the plaintiffs' ability to subsequently refile their claims. Judge Moreno also dismissed, with prejudice, the plaintiffs' federal prompt pay law claims. The Company currently expects that a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion to certify a class will be held in early May 2001. On March 26, 2001, the California Medical Association filed an amended complaint in its lawsuit, alleging, among other things, revised RICO claims and violations of California law.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency and inflation. All these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding these risks.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our Senior Secured Facility and Subordinated Facility, which carry variable interest rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure\nto loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates. Our Senior Secured Facility and Subordinated Facility bear interest at variable rates, which exposes us to market risks relating to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2019, we had $15.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding under our Senior Secured Facility and $50.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding under our Subordinated Facility. Based on December 31, 2019 debt levels, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the effective interest rate on the Senior Secured Facility and our Subordinated Facility would cause an increase in interest expense of approximately $0.4 million and a decrease of approximately $0.2 million over the next 12 months.We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAll our domestic product sales, inventory purchases, and operating expenses have been denominated in U.S. dollars. We therefore have not had any foreign currency risk associated with these activities. The functional currency of all our entities is the U.S. dollar, other than Casper Sleep (UK) Limited which is the British pound, and Casper Sleep GmbH and Casper Sleep SAS, which are the euro. Product sales and inventory purchases for these entities are primarily in their functional currency (e.g. British pounds and euros). Additionally, we incur a portion of operating expenses in Canadian dollars, British pounds and euros. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, covering principally the British Pound, the European Union euro, Canadian dollar, and Chinese RMB. However, we believe functional currency revenues and expenses mostly provide a natural hedge and that the exposure to foreign currency fluctuation from product sales and operating expenses is immaterial currently as the related product sales and costs do not constitute a significant portion of our sales revenue, net and expenses. As we grow our operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange contracts and currently do not expect to enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our historical results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial. We cannot assure you, however, that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A is a disclosure of the market risks that the company is exposed to, including interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, and inflation.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\nASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT\nThe principal objective of the Company's asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts and in off-balance sheet commitments, determine the appropriate level of risk given the Company's business focus, operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives, establish prudent asset concentration guidelines and manage the risk consistent with Board of Directors approved guidelines. Through such management, the Company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates and to manage the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or repricing dates.\nThe Company's profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income, which is the difference between its interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and its interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-earning assets reprice differently than its interest-bearing liabilities.\nInterest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the Company's operating results or financial position to adverse movements in market interest rates which mainly occur when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and at different rates. The Company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk, ensuring adequate liquidity, and coordinating its sources and uses of funds. Specific strategies have included shortening the amortized maturity of fixed-rate loans and increasing the volume of variable rate loans to reduce the average maturity of the Company's interest-earning assets and entering into interest rate exchange agreements (swaps) to hedge variable term notes and fixed callable certificates of deposit.\nThe Company is exposed to changes in the level of Net Interest Income (\"NII\") in a changing interest rate environment. NII will fluctuate pursuant to changes in the levels of interest rates and of interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. If (1) the weighted average rates in effect at year end remain constant, or increase or decrease on an instantaneous and sustained change of plus or minus 200 basis points, and (2) all scheduled repricing, reinvestments and estimated prepayments, and reissuances are at such constant, or increase or decrease accordingly; NII will fluctuate as shown on the table below:\nDecember 31, 2000:\nDecember 31, 1999:\n- --------------- The NII figures exclude the effect of the amortization of loan fees.\nDuring 2000, the Bank converted about $600.0 million fixed rate liabilities into variable rate liabilities. In addition, it converted about $200.0 million fixed rate purchased loans into variable rate loans and purchased about $262.0 million of variable rate loans, reducing the Bank's exposure to changes in interest rates.\nThe model utilized to create the information presented above makes various estimates at each level of interest rate change regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities and/or call activity on investment securities. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change. In addition, the limits stated above do not necessarily represent the level of change under which management would undertake specific measures to realign its portfolio in order to reduce the projected level of change.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text provides an overview of the Company's asset and liability management function.

This litigation is ongoing.\nOn December 1, 2017, The United States District Court for the Central District of California issued an opinion in the StrikeForce Technologies, Inc. v. SecureAuth Corp. case, which invalidated claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,870,599, 8,484,698 and 8,713,701 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101. We strongly disagreed with the Court\u2019s decision and an appeal was filed by our attorney in July 2019. In October 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States denied our petition for a writ of certiorari in StrikeForce Technologies, Inc. v. SecureAuth Corp (19-103). Thus, the claims asserted against SecureAuth in the Central District of California, case no. 2:17-cv-04314-JAK-SK, remain invalid under 35 U.S.C. 101. Our three patents contain a total of 108 claims, 43 claims were deemed invalid, however, 65 claims are still valid. Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, our Protect ID\u00ae products still retain patent protection and our management intends to further expand those protections with new patents in the coming months. In the meantime, we continue to monitor the Federal Courts because there are several cases (i.e. Berkheimer v.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFinancial Risk Management\nThe main goal of Bio-Rad\u2019s financial risk management program is to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes. Financial exposures are managed through operational means and by using various financial instruments, including cash and liquid resources, borrowings, and forward and spot foreign exchange contracts. No derivative financial instruments are entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation. Company policy requires that all derivative positions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities. These derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Derivative instruments used in these transactions are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are included in reported earnings.\nForeign Exchange Risk. We operate and conduct business in many countries and are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Additionally, our consolidated net equity is impacted by the conversion of the net assets of our international subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nForeign currency exposures are managed on a centralized basis. This allows for the netting of natural offsets and lowers transaction costs and net exposures. Where possible, we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including matching same-currency revenues to same-currency costs, and same-currency assets to same-currency liabilities. Moreover, weakening in one currency can often be offset by strengthening in another currency. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. Positions are primarily in Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan and British Sterling. The majority of forward contracts are for periods of 90 days or less. We record the change in value of our foreign currency receivables and payables as a Foreign exchange (gain) loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income along with the change in fair market value of the forward exchange contract used as an economic hedge of those assets or liabilities.\nOur forward contract holdings at year-end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All other variables were held constant. Market risk associated with derivative holdings is the potential change in fair value of derivative positions arising from an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates. A decline of 10% on quoted foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate net-present-value loss of $25 million on our derivative position as of December 31, 2019. This impact of a change in exchange rates excludes the offset derived from the change in value of the underlying assets and liabilities, which could reduce the adverse effect significantly.\nInterest Rate Risk of Debt Instruments. Bio-Rad centrally manages the short-term cash surpluses and shortfalls of its subsidiaries. Our holdings of variable rate debt instruments at year-end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to movements in interest rates. Due to the relatively small amount of short-term variable rate debt we have outstanding, there would not be a material impact to earnings or cash flows if interest rates moved adversely by 10%. Our long-term debt consists primarily of fixed-rate instruments, and is thus insulated from interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2019, the overall interest rate risk associated with our debt was not significant.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Bio-Rad's financial risk management program seeks to reduce the variance in expected cash flows arising from unexpected foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As part of an overall risk management strategy, Harken considers the use of derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce risks associated with these factors.\nCommodity Price Risk -- Harken is a producer of hydrocarbon commodities, including crude oil, condensate and natural gas. Harken uses oil and gas derivative financial instruments, limited to swaps and options with maturities of 24 months or less, to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas commodity prices on future crude oil and natural gas production. Harken enters into no commodity derivative financial instruments other than those which are designed to be effective in mitigating commodity price risk of Harken's oil and gas production. Harken uses the sensitivity analysis method to disclose its quantitative disclosure of commodity price risk exposure. Accordingly, Harken has evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in commodity prices would have had on the fair value of its commodity price risk sensitive financial instruments at year end 2000. Assuming a 20% increase in natural gas prices, the potential increase in the fair value of Harken's natural gas swap contract obligations at December 31, 2000 would have been approximately $740,000. At December 31, 2000 Harken had no financial instrument risk exposure related to increases or decreases in crude oil prices.\nInterest Rate Risk -- Harken invests cash in interest-bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers. Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments\nare classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a significant interest rate risk to Harken. Harken considers its interest rate risk exposure related to long-term debt obligations is also not significant, as at December 31, 2000 all but approximately $9,937,000 of Harken's financing obligations carry a fixed interest rate per annum. Harken has no open interest rate swaps agreements.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk -- Harken conducts international business in Colombia and Costa Rica and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, and capital expenditures. However, because predominately all material transactions in Harken's existing foreign operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all operations. Exposure from transactions in currencies other than U.S. dollars is not considered material.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Harken is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk. With our outstanding debt following our acquisition of Cavium, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding Term Loan, including changes that may result from implementation of new benchmark rates that replace LIBOR. See \u201cNote 12 - Debt\u201d for further information. A hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate by 1% would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense by approximately $3.3 million to $7.6 million.\nWe maintain an investment policy that requires minimum credit ratings, diversification of credit risk and limits the long-term interest rate risk by requiring effective maturities of generally less than five years. We invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, money market mutual funds, asset backed securities, corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale and time deposits. These investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with their related unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of shareholders\u2019 equity. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. At February 2, 2019, our investment portfolio balance was $0.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. All of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. Since we operate in many countries, a percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and exchange volatility could positively or negatively impact those operating costs. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we may hold certain assets and liabilities, including potential tax liabilities, in local currency on our consolidated balance sheet. These tax liabilities would be settled in local currency. Therefore, foreign exchange gains and losses from remeasuring the tax liabilities are recorded to interest and other income, net. We do not believe that foreign exchange volatility has a material impact on our current business or results of operations. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business or results of operations in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies.\nWe may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within operating expense, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, our operating expense could increase by approximately 2%.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: Marvell Technology Group is exposed to various forms of market risk, including potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on their outstanding Term Loan.

Our integrated enterprise risk management framework is designed to identify, evaluate, communicate, and appropriately mitigate risks across our operations.\nWe face market risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. We manage market risks through procurement strategies as well as the use of derivative and other financial instruments. Our risk management program is governed by policies that authorize and control the nature and scope of transactions that we use to mitigate market risks. Our policy permits the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate market risks but prohibits their use for speculative purposes.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk. Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency-denominated cash flows. In general, we expect our cash flows to be negatively affected by a stronger dollar and positively affected by a weaker dollar. Our most significant foreign currency exposures include the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Polish zloty, the Mexican peso, and the Russian ruble. We manage our foreign currency exposures through derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward contracts, and debt denominated in foreign currency. We had outstanding currency derivatives with notional amounts totaling $1,241 million and $1,026 million at April 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nWe estimate that a hypothetical 10% weakening of the dollar compared to exchange rates of hedged currencies as of April 30, 2020, would decrease the fair value of our then-existing foreign currency derivative contracts by approximately $75 million. This hypothetical change in fair value does not consider the expected inverse change in the underlying foreign currency exposures.\nCommodity price risk. Commodity price changes can affect our production and supply chain costs. Our most significant commodities exposures include corn, malted barley, rye, natural gas, agave, and wood. We manage certain exposures through a combination of purchase orders and long-term supply contracts.\nInterest rate risk. Interest rate changes affect (a) the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, and (b) cash flows and earnings related to our variable-rate debt and interest-bearing investments. In addition to currently outstanding debt, any potential future debt offerings are subject to interest rate risk. Our interest rate exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, European Central Bank rates, British government rates, and LIBOR.\nAs of April 30, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents ($675 million) and short-term borrowings ($333 million) were exposed to interest rate changes. Based on the then-existing balances of these items, a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a negligible decrease in net interest expense.\nSee Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign currency exchange rate risk.

We entered into separate agreements with the school districts under which we assisted the districts with preparing and submitting claims to the state Medicaid agency which, in turn, submitted claims for reimbursement to CMS. The state has asserted that its agreement with us requires us to reimburse the state for the amounts owed to CMS. However, our agreements with the school districts require them to reimburse us for such amounts, and therefore we believe the school districts are responsible for any amounts that ultimately must be refunded to CMS. Although it is reasonably possible that a court could conclude we are responsible for the full balance of the disallowances, we believe our exposure in this matter is limited to our fees associated with this work and that the school districts will be responsible for the remainder. We have reserved our estimated fees earned from this engagement relating to the disallowances.

The Company uses these derivative instruments to hedge exposures in the ordinary course of business and does not invest in derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The credit risk under these interest rate and foreign currency agreements is not considered to be significant. The Company attempts to manage market and credit risks associated with its derivative instruments by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken, and by entering into transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings. As of August 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s derivative counterparty had an investment grade credit rating.\nThe Company has manufacturing operations in the United States, Brazil, France, Italy, China, Turkey, and South Africa. The Company has sold products throughout the world and purchases certain of its components from third-party international suppliers. Export sales made from the United States are principally U.S. dollar denominated. At times, export sales may be denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. A majority of the Company\u2019s revenue generated from operations outside the United States is denominated in local currency. Accordingly, these sales are not typically subject to significant foreign currency transaction risk. The Company\u2019s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the Euro, the Brazilian real, the South African rand, the Turkish lira, and the Chinese renminbi in relation to the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures, which can adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Based on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended August 31, 2019, the Company estimates the potential decrease in operating income from a ten percent adverse change in the underlying exchange rates, in U.S. dollar terms, would be approximately $0.5 million.\nIn order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company, at times, may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of its operations. This activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory, sales of finished goods, intercompany transactions and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. The Company had $1.8 million of U.S. dollar equivalent cash flow forward exchange contracts and option contracts outstanding as of August 31, 2019.\nIn order to reduce translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of its international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars, the Company, at times, utilizes Euro foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its Euro net investment exposure in its foreign operations. At August 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding Euro foreign currency forward contracts to sell 32.7 million Euro at fixed prices expected to settle during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. At August 31, 2019, the Company also had an outstanding foreign currency forward contract to sell 43.0 million South African rand at fixed prices to settle during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Based on the net investments contracts outstanding at August 31, 2019, the Company estimates the potential decrease in fair value from a ten percent adverse change in the underlying exchange rates would be approximately $3.4 million. This decrease in fair value would be reflected as a reduction to other comprehensive income offsetting the translation exposure or adjustment of the international subsidiaries.\nITEM 8", "summary": "A - The Company uses certain financial derivatives to mitigate its exposure to volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\nWe are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In addition, our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, and other regulations and restrictions.\nForeign currency exchange rates. Our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies. International revenues represented 48% of our total revenues in 2000, as compared with 46% in 1999. In addition, the identifiable net assets of our foreign operations totaled 18% of consolidated assets at both December 31, 2000 and 1999. Our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business. We operate outside the United States primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe, Asia/ Pacific, Canada and Latin America. We have determined that the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency and as such, foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign subsidiaries resulted in our reporting unrealized foreign currency exchange losses of $1.5 million 2000, as compared with $557,000 in 1999. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions. Foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct operations as compared to the U.S. Dollar, and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure. We prepared sensitivity analyses of our exposures from foreign net assets as of December 31, 2000, to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates. Based upon the results of these analyses, a 10% adverse change in all foreign currency rates from the December 31, 2000 rates would result in a currency translation loss of $1.7 million before tax.\nInterest rates. We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, including bank time deposits, and variable and fixed rate obligations of the U.S. Government and its agencies, states, municipalities, commercial paper and corporate bonds. These investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We classify all of our investments as available-for-sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, \u201cAccounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.\u201d Cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short-term deposits of the local operating bank. Interest income earned on our investments is reflected in our financial statements under the caption \u201cOther income, net.\u201d\nInvestments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to a change in interest rates. We hold our investment securities for purposes other than trading.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. We continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them.\nInterest Rate Risk - Nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2019, approximately 24% of Nucor\u2019s long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. The remaining 76% of Nucor\u2019s long-term debt was at fixed rates. Future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. Nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2019, there were no such contracts outstanding. Nucor\u2019s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments.\nCommodity Price Risk - In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. We attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. In periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. When demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. Our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs. DRI is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic steel production.\nNatural gas produced by Nucor\u2019s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our Louisiana DRI facility and our steel mills in the United States.\nNucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. Gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in net earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. At December 31, 2019, accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes included $14.0 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. Changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. The following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of the derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2019, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands):\nAny resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. These hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities.\nForeign Currency Risk - Nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in Canada, Europe and Mexico. We periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. Open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were insignificant.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks, which it manages through a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, interest rate swaps, and investments in highly liquid securities with short maturities.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company\u2019s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. To manage such risks effectively, the Company enters into hedging transactions, pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk. Derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities, where appropriate. A secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non-specific exposure within established limits and policies; derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges. The potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the Company\u2019s results.\nThe global nature of the Company\u2019s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets. The Company has assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary objective of the Company\u2019s foreign currency risk management is to optimize the U.S. dollar value of net assets and cash flows. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts, over-the-counter option contracts, cross-currency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies. Exposures primarily relate to assets, liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies, as well as economic exposure, which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities. The largest exposures are denominated in European currencies, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, although exposures also exist in the Canadian dollar, the Indian rupee and other currencies in Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.\nThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges using interest rate swaps, \u201cswaptions,\u201d and exchange-traded instruments. The Company\u2019s primary exposure is to the U.S. dollar yield curve.\nThe Company has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries. This exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the Company\u2019s market risk policies and procedures.\nInherent in the Company\u2019s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. Some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments. Natural gas and crude oil, along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production, constitute the main commodity exposures. Over-the-counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks, when feasible.\nThe Company uses value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d), stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes. VAR estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values, given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time, using specified confidence levels. The VAR methodology used by the Company is a variance/covariance model. This model uses a 97.5 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data. The 2019 and 2018 year-end and average daily VAR for the aggregate of all positions are shown below. These amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s composite VAR for the aggregate of all positions decreased from $145 million at December 31, 2018 to $137 million at December 31, 2019. The interest rate and commodities VAR declined due to a decrease in exposure. The equity securities VAR declined due to a decrease in managed exposures and lower equity volatility. The foreign exchange VAR increased due to increased hedging.

Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end. We have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given that exposure to date has not been material. In 2020, changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced our reported net sales by $5.7 with the estimated effect on our net earnings being immaterial.\nCommodity steel pricing - We buy and sell various types of steel products; these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners and related hardware. We are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers. During 2020, the price of commodity steel as reflected in many market indexes fell sharply early in the year as business activity declined in response to actions to address the COVID-19 pandemic, recovered sharply as business activity rebounded, and finished 2020 above the preceding year end levels. During 2019, the price of commodity steel as reflected in many market indexes declined.\nCommodity energy prices - We have market risk for changes in prices of oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity. Prices for gasoline and diesel were mostly lower over the course of 2020 as business activity declined in response to actions to address the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we experienced lower fuel costs through most of 2020. In 2019, prices for gasoline and diesel were stable in the early part of the year, but began to decline in the latter part of the year with slowing economic activity. As a result, we experienced stable fuel costs through 2019. Fossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that we sell. Although fuel prices were lower through much of 2020, we experienced stable, not lower, prices for products with high chemical or plastic content. Stable fuel costs in 2019 resulted in stable product costs. We believe that over time these risks are mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight and product costs to our customers, the efficiency of our trucking distribution network, and the ability, over time, to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency. In 2020, our estimated net earnings exposure for commodity energy prices was immaterial.\nInterest rates - Loans under our Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates tied to LIBOR (or, if LIBOR is no longer available, at a replacement rate to be determined by the administrative agent for the Credit Facility and consented to by us). As a result, changes in LIBOR can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place. We have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our Credit Facility. A one percentage point increase in LIBOR in 2020 would have resulted in approximately $1.3 of additional interest expense. A description of our Credit Facility is contained in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as foreign currency exchange rates, commodity steel pricing, commodity energy prices, and interest rates. The company evaluates and manages these risks by not hedging foreign currency risk, passing through impacts of commodity steel pricing to customers, managing fuel costs, and not using interest rate swap arrangements. In 2020, changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced net sales by $5.7, while a one percentage point increase in LIBOR would have resulted in approximately $1.3 of additional interest expense."}
{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk\nInsignia is exposed to a variety of market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates. The Company's earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from the Company's operations in foreign jurisdictions. In addition to the United States, the Company conducts business in the following foreign jurisdictions: the U.K., Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, China, Thailand and Mexico. The British Pound (Sterling) represents the only foreign currency of a material business operation, as more than 90% of Insignia's foreign operations were derived in the U.K. for both 2000 and 1999.\nThe Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and weak economic conditions in these foreign markets. These foreign factors have not had a material adverse effect on the Company; however, they could potentially have a material adverse affect on the Company's future financial position and results of operations. A 10% change in the British pound at December 31, 2000 would have had an estimated impact of approximately $14 million on revenues and $1.4 million on earnings. As previously noted, the Company realized foreign currency gains of approximately $1.4 million in 2000 and $827,000 in 1999, principally from facility borrowings in declining European currencies.\nThe Company's interest income and expense are most sensitive to the changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments as well as interest paid on its debt. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond the Company's control. A 100 basis point change in interest rates at current cash and debt levels would have an estimated annual net impact of less than $1 million on the Company's results of operations. However, changes in interest rates can have a material adverse effect on Realty One's home brokerage and mortgage origination business in northern Ohio. As evidence, increases in mortgage interest rates during 2000 spurred a weak environment for single-family home sales. As a result, Realty One experienced a sharp decline in sales volume and mortgage financing activities with revenues and earnings for 2000 off $4.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively, compared to 1999.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk: Insignia is exposed to a variety of market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates.

All derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with settlements of such contracts and changes in the unrealized fair value recorded as price risk management activities income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations in each period.\nCommodity Price Risks\nOil and natural gas prices can fluctuate significantly and have a direct impact on our revenues, earnings and cash flow. During year ended December 31, 2019, our average oil price realizations after the effect of derivatives increased 4% to $59.23 per Bbl from $57.12 per Bbl in the comparable 2018 period. Our average natural gas price realizations after the effect of derivatives decreased 19% during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.55 per Mcf from $3.16 per Mcf in the comparable 2018 period.\nPrice Risk Management Activities\nWe have attempted to mitigate commodity price risk and stabilize cash flows associated with our forecasted sales of oil and natural gas production through the use of oil and natural gas swaps. These contracts will impact our earnings as the fair value of these derivatives changes. Our derivatives will not mitigate all of the commodity price risks of our forecasted sales of oil and natural gas production and, as a result, we will be subject to commodity price risks on our remaining forecasted production.\nWe had commodity derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future production of 9,638 MBbls of crude oil and 5,935 MMBtu of natural gas at December 31, 2019, with a net derivative liability position of $11.6 million.

Of this, $389.9 million was from our 11.00% Notes and 7.50% Notes, which bear interest at fixed rates. The remaining $343.1 million is from borrowings under our Bank Credit Facility with variable interest rates. We are subject to the risk of changes in interest rates under our Bank Credit Facility. In addition, the terms of our Bank Credit Facility require us to pay higher interest rates as we utilize a larger percentage of our available borrowing base. We manage our interest rate exposure by maintaining a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and monitoring the effect of market changes in interest rates. We believe our interest rate risk exposure is partially mitigated as a result of fixed interest rates on 53% of our debt. The interest rate on our variable rate debt at December 31, 2019 was 4.79%.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk and to a lesser extent, foreign currency risk. We may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and fund acquisition, expansion, and financing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness was approximately $109.1 million, which included approximately $107.0 million in variable rate debt and approximately $2.2 million in fixed rate debt, less approximately $75,000 in debt issuance costs. As of December 31, 2018, our total indebtedness was approximately $63.8 million, which included approximately $62.0 million in variable rate debt and approximately $2.3 million in fixed rate debt, less approximately $0.5 million in debt issuance costs. A change in interest rates on variable debt could impact the interest incurred and cash flows and its fair value. If the underlying rate of the related index on our variable rate debt were to increase by 100 basis points, the increase in interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.1 million annually.\nInterest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.\nThe following table summarizes future debt maturities and average interest rates on our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2019:\n(1)\nInterest expense for the variable rate debt was calculated based on the rate in effect on December 31, 2019. Interest expense on the Revolving KeyBank Credit Facility is calculated presuming the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2019 would remain outstanding through the maturity date of June 27, 2022. Interest expense on the Katy Loan is calculated presuming the amount outstanding as of December 31, 2019 would remain outstanding through the maturity date of September 1, 2031.\n(2)\nOn January 31, 2020, we entered into a 10 year, interest only CMBS Loan for $40.5 million.

The Company does not and currently does not intend to hedge exchange rate fluctuations between United States dollars and foreign currencies. However, from time to time, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate exposures. An instrument will be treated as a hedge if it is effective in offsetting the impact of volatility in the Company's underlying interest rate exposures. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.\nRevenue from international customers represented approximately 13% of 2000 net revenues. At December 31, 2000, there were no material non-United States dollar denominated financial instruments outstanding which exposed the Company to foreign exchange risk.\nAs noted above, the Company is exposed to market risk associated with adverse movements in interest rates. Specifically, the Company is primarily exposed to changes in the fair value of its $110 million senior subordinated notes, and to changes in earnings and related cash flows on its variable interest rate debt obligations outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility and its retained interests related to trade accounts receivable and equipment loans sold to the Company's special purpose finance subsidiaries. Borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility totaled $199.5 million at December 31, 2000.\nThe fair value of the Company's senior subordinated notes was approximately $82.5 million based upon prevailing prices in recent market transactions as of December 31, 2000. The Company\nestimates that this fair value would increase/decrease by approximately $5.7 million based upon an assumed 10% decrease/increase in interest rates compared with the effective yield on the senior subordinated notes as of December 31, 2000.\nAn assumed 10% increase/decrease in the variable interest rate of 9.2% in effect at December 31, 2000 related to the term loan borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility would decrease/increase annualized earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.9 million.\nEffective March 10, 1999, the Company entered into a $67 million interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution to hedge a portion of its interest rate risk related to its term loan borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. Under the swap, which has a term of three years, the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.962% and receives quarterly interest payments based upon LIBOR. The differential between the fixed and floating interest rates under the swap is accrued and is recorded as an adjustment of interest expense. The effect of this agreement on the Company's interest expense during 2000 was a reduction of $1.0 million. The fair value of this interest rate swap agreement which represents the amount that the Company would receive to settle the instrument is $0.7 million at December 31, 2000.\nAn assumed 10% increase/decrease in interest rates under the Asset Backed Facility at December 31, 2000 would not have a material effect on the fair value of the retained interest in sold trade accounts receivable due to the short-term nature of the underlying receivables. Finally, based upon the mix of variable and fixed rate equipment loans sold by the Company, a 10% increase/decrease in interest rates would decrease/increase the fair value of the Company's retained interests at December 31, 2000 of $21.4 million by less than $1.0 million.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.

These risks are described in the sections that follow.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had $885.0 million in fixed rate senior notes outstanding. As of March 31, 2019, we had $301.8 million in outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement which are exposed to changes in interest rates. We monitor our interest rate risk, but do not engage in any hedging activities using derivative financial instruments. For additional information regarding our debt structure, refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements titled, \u201cDebt.\u201d\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nWe are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This foreign currency exchange risk arises when we conduct business in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. For most operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. The financial statements of subsidiaries are translated to their U.S. dollar equivalents at end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and at average currency exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Translation adjustments for subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \u201c Reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss),\u201d contains additional information about the impact of translation on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and equity. Transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Since we operate internationally and approximately 30% of our revenues and 40% of our cost of revenues are generated outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact our financial position, results of operations, and competitive position.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including inter-company transactions. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At March 31, 2019, we held foreign currency forward contracts to buy 9.0 million Canadian dollars and 150.0 million Mexican pesos.\nCOMMODITY RISK\nWe are dependent on basic raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies used in our operations. Our financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials. Some of these materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or only a single supplier. These materials are also key source materials for our competitors. Therefore, if demand for these materials rises, we may experience increased costs and/or limited or unavailable supplies. As a result, we may not be able to acquire key production materials on a timely basis, which could impact our ability to produce products and satisfy incoming sales orders on a timely basis. In addition, the costs of these materials can rise suddenly and result in significantly higher costs of production. We believe that we have adequate sources of supply for many of our key materials and energy sources. Where appropriate, we enter into long-term supply contracts as a basis to guarantee a reliable supply. We may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in a certain commodity that impacts raw materials included in our cost of revenues.

The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.\nPSE's objective is to minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios. It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. PSE hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.\nPSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools including a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE\u2019s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions. Based on the analytics from all of its models and tools, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options to manage its electric and natural gas portfolio risks. The forward physical electric and natural gas contracts are both fixed and variable (at index). To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts.

As the gains and losses in the electric portfolio are realized, they will be recorded as either purchased power costs or electric generation fuel costs under the PCA mechanism. Any fair value adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, due to the PGA mechanism, which passes the cost of natural gas supply to customers. As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism.\nA hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company\u2019s derivative contracts by $30.1 million.\nThe change in fair value of the Company\u2019s outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2018, through December 31, 2019, is summarized in the table below:\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2019, based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:\n_______________\n1.Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.\nFor further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings, see Note 10, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" and Note 11, \"Fair Value Measurements\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8", "summary": "of this Form 10-K.\n\nPuget Sound Energy (PSE) manages its energy risk portfolio by establishing policies and procedures to minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.

Assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn as of December 31, 2019, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $4 million change in annual interest expense on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe following table summarizes information about our debt as of December 31, 2019 (after considering the impact of the effective interest rate swaps), including the principal cash payments and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates based on applicable rates at December 31, 2019.\n__________________________________\n(1)Before the application of the applicable borrowing margin.\nFuel Price Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk for changes in fuel prices through the consumption of fuel by our vehicle fleet in the delivery of services to our customers. We expect to use approximately 14 million gallons of fuel in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, a 10 percent change in fuel prices would result in a change of approximately $4 million in our annual fuel cost before considering the impact of fuel swap contracts.\nWe use fuel swap contracts to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices. As of December 31, 2019, we had fuel swap contracts to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of $31 million, maturing through 2021. The estimated fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2019 was a net asset of $1 million. These fuel swap contracts provide a fixed price for approximately 80 percent of our estimated fuel usage for 2020.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are principally exposed to foreign currency exchange risk in Swedish krona and Norwegian krone, but also have foreign currency exchange risk related to the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate can have an impact on our operating results. As of December 31, 2019, a 10 percent change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks faced by a company, including interest rate risk, fuel price risk, and foreign currency risk. The company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, but does use financial arrangements such as fuel swap agreements and interest rate swap agreements to manage certain market risks. As of December 31, 2019, a 10 percent change in fuel prices would result in a change of approximately $4 million in the company's annual fuel cost, and a 10 percent change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company's results of operations."}
{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nUnder smaller reporting company rules we are not required to disclose information required under Item 7A. However, in order to provide information to our investors, we have elected to provide information related to market risk.\nThe Company's primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk. Investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates, overall market conditions, underwriting results, regulatory requirements and tax position. Investment decisions are made by management and reviewed by the Board of Directors. Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities. The three potential risks related\nto the Company's fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk, prepayment risk and default risk. The primary risk related to the Company's equity portfolio is equity price risk.\nSince the Company's assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature, the Company's financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities, changes in spreads over U.S. Treasuries on new investment opportunities and changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks.\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities. The Company holds common stock with a fair value of $5,303,000. Our portfolio has historically been highly correlated to the S&P 500 with regard to market risk. Based on an evaluation of the historical risk measure of our portfolio relative to the S&P 500, if the market value of the S&P 500 Index decreased 10% from its December 31, 2019 value, the fair value of the Company's common stock investments would decrease by approximately $530,000.\nCertain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values. Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements present additional disclosures concerning fair values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and are incorporated by reference herein.\nThe Company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by entities considered to be financially stable, the majority of the assets are issued by U.S. government sponsored entities or corporate entities with debt considered to be \"investment grade\".\nThe Company's investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value. This approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed, primarily dividend paying companies, which have a low debt to capital ratio, above average return on capital for a sustained period of time, and low volatility rating (beta) relative to the market. The dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities, and it has been the Company's experience that by following this investment strategy, long-term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds, while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market.\nAs for shifts in investment allocations, the Company has used improved cash flows from insurance operations to increase allocations to fixed maturity securities in order to limit volatility of statutory capital of the insurance subsidiaries.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: The Company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to its fixed maturity and equity portfolios. The Company limits its exposure to market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by financially stable entities and by following an investment approach based on fundamental analysis of value.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe have various market risk exposures that arise from our ongoing business operations. Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Our financial results are impacted by changes in interest rates, certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.\nForeign Currencies\nWe have manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world. As a result, we make investments and conduct business transactions denominated in various currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the European euro, the Czech koruna, the Japanese yen and the Indian rupee. Total annual foreign sales, including foreign export sales, averaged approximately $313.3 million over the last three years. Foreign sales represented 44.4% of consolidated net sales in 2019; however, a significant portion of our foreign sales are denominated in the U.S. dollar. We estimate a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S dollar for 2019 would have had an unfavorable impact of $12.3 million on sales and a favorable impact of $0.2 million on operating income. We manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the subsidiary operations level. Sometimes we may, through the use of forward contracts or other derivative contracts, hedge the price risk associated with committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and rates. Historically the use of these forward contracts has been minimal. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.\nInterest Rates\nOur primary exposure to interest rate risk results from our outstanding debt obligations. The level of fees and interest charged on revolving credit commitments and borrowings are based upon leverage levels and market interest rates.\nOur principal debt facilities are contained within a variable rate credit agreement that provides a $800.0 million revolving credit facility. This agreement was amended and restated on December 13, 2019 (as amended), and expires on December 13, 2024. Total average bank borrowings for 2019 were $70.6 million. The impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the interest rates on our average bank borrowings would have resulted in a $0.7 million increase in interest expense.\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal of convertible unsecured senior notes, due May 2024, in a private placement offering. These notes bear 3.25% interest per annum on the principal amount, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2017, and have an effective interest rate of 5.0%.\nFrom time to time we will enter into interest rate swap contracts for the purpose of securing a fixed interest rate on our variable interest rate borrowings. These contracts allow us to create certainty with respect to future cash flows associated with our variable rate debt that would otherwise be impacted by fluctuations in LIBOR rates.\nCommodity Prices\nWe are exposed to volatility in the price of raw materials used in certain manufacturing operations. These raw materials include, but are not limited to, aluminum, titanium, nickel, copper and other specialty metals. We manage our exposure related to these price changes through strategic procurement practices.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe company has various market risk exposures that arise from its ongoing business operations, such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates,\ncommodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate and foreign currency risks as follows:\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned on and the market value of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of bank deposit accounts, money market funds, U.S. government agency debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities. Our securities with fixed interest rates may have their market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates. As a result, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated income statements unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or incur an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. An immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would have a $2.4 million effect on the fair market value of our portfolio as of December 31, 2019. Our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operations outside of the United States incur a portion of their operating expenses in foreign currencies, principally the Euro, but these expenses are immaterial compared to our overall expenses. To date, the majority of our product sales and inventory purchases have been denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, the functional currency of all of our entities is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded foreign currency transaction losses of $0.2 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. These foreign currency transaction losses have been recorded as a component of \u201cother expense, net\u201d in our consolidated income statements. We believe that a 10% change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Euro would not materially impact our operating results or financial position. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange contracts. In future periods, we may hedge certain significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as we expand our international operations.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business. However, if global demand for the base materials utilized in our suppliers\u2019 components were to significantly increase for the components we purchase from our suppliers to manufacture our products, our costs could become subject to significant inflationary pressures, and we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and costs of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure. The derivatives we use are instruments with liquid markets. See Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nOur consolidated earnings, which are reported in United States dollars, are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk is concentrated in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro; the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar; and the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan.\nOur non-U.S. subsidiaries transact most business, including certain intercompany transactions, in foreign currencies. Such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in European currencies or the U.S. or Canadian dollar. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time to manage the risk related to intercompany loans, intercompany purchases and intercompany sales that occur during the course of a year, and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, we entered into forward exchange contracts that settle quarterly and which hedge approximately 70% to 80% of the forecasted intercompany purchases between one of our Canadian subsidiaries and our U.S. operating subsidiaries for the next twelve months. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we entered into forward exchange contracts which hedge up to 60% of the forecasted intercompany sales transactions between one of our Chinese subsidiaries and one of our U.S. operating subsidiaries for the next twelve months. We record the effective portion of the designated foreign currency hedge contracts in other comprehensive income until inventory turns and is sold to a third-party. Once the third-party transaction occurs associated with the hedged forecasted transaction, the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the designated foreign currency hedge will be reclassified into earnings. The fair value of our designated foreign hedge contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was a liability balance of $0.2 million.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we can choose either an Adjusted LIBOR or Alternative Base Rate (\u201cABR\u201d). Accordingly, the Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows are exposed to interest rate risk from changes in Adjusted LIBOR. In order to manage our exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in LIBOR-indexed interest payments related to our floating rate debt, we entered into two interest rate swaps. For each interest rate swap, we receive the three-month USD-LIBOR subject to a 0% floor, and pay a fixed rate of 1.31375% on a notional amount of $225.0 million. Information about our long-term debt including principal amounts and related interest rates appears in Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe purchase significant amounts of bronze ingot, brass rod, cast iron, stainless steel, steel, plastic and other materials, which are utilized in manufacturing our many product lines. Our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if we are unable to pass on related price increases to our customers.

To mitigate some of these risks, we utilize currency forward contracts. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including corporate obligations and money market funds. As of December 31, 2000, approximately 86% of our total portfolio will mature in one year or less, with the remainder maturing in less than two years.\nThe following table represents the fair value balance of our cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of December 31, 2000 (dollars in thousands):\nWe did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of December 31, 2000, and we have never held such instruments in the past. In addition, we had outstanding debt, consisting of borrowings under an equipment financing line of credit, of $1.8 million as of December 31, 2000, with a range of interest rates of between 11.73% and 12.78%.\nAt December 31, 1999 our interest rate risk was confined to our cash and cash equivalents, which have maturities of less than three months. Due to their very short-term nature, these investments were subject to minimal interest rate risk.\nForeign Currency Risk\nA substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, beginning in fiscal 2000 we began to enter into transactions in Danish kroner. To protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates, we have established balance sheet hedging programs. Currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses on these foreign currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in negligible net exposure to Maxygen.\nAt December 31, 2000 we had a total of $14.5 million committed in foreign currency cash flow forward contracts.

The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Company\u2019s Euro denominated borrowings, is reflected in the Accumulated other comprehensive loss component of Equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2019 (net of the translation effect of our Euro denominated borrowings) would result in a reduction in Equity of approximately $141 million.\nWe also face exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the U.S. and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Although we use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for reporting purposes, we have manufacturing sites throughout the world, and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred and sales are generated in foreign currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nWe have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements in the translation of our financial statements into U.S. dollars without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will, therefore, continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in the prices of raw materials used in our production processes. Commodity futures contracts are periodically used to manage such exposure. As of December 31, 2019, our open commodity futures contracts were not material.\nSee Note 17, \u201cFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our derivative instruments.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk, and commodity price risk. The company addresses these risks through normal operating and financing activities, and may enter into interest rate swap or collar agreements to mitigate interest rate risk.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nIn order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, our long-term Credit Facility bears a variable interest rate based on prime, federal funds, or LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on our total net leverage ratio. The nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. We may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations, but as of December 28, 2019, we have not entered into any such contracts. Based on the balance outstanding under our Term Loan A at December 28, 2019, we estimate that a 1% increase or decrease in underlying interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by $3.0 million in any given fiscal year. See Item 1A, Risk Factors under \u201cThe uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact our operating results\u201d for a discussion of the interest rate risk related the potential phase-out of LIBOR in 2021.\nInflation Risk\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe primary raw materials and components used by our contract manufacturing partners include polyethylene, polyurethane foam, stainless-steel, polyester fabric, zippers, and plastic. We believe these materials are readily available from multiple vendors. We have, and may continue to, negotiate prices with suppliers of these products on behalf of our third-party contract manufacturers in order to leverage the cumulative impact of our volume. We do not, however, source significant amounts of these products directly. Certain of these products use petroleum or natural gas as inputs. However, we do not believe there is a significant direct correlation between petroleum or natural gas prices and the costs of our products.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur international sales are primarily denominated in the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar and any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and these currencies could have an adverse impact on our revenue. During 2019, net sales from our international entities accounted for 4% of our consolidated net sales, and therefore we do not believe exposure to foreign currency fluctuations would have a material impact on our net sales. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the Unites States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, our suppliers may incur many costs, including labor costs, in other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our gross margin. In addition, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar may increase the cost of our products to our customers outside of the United States. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, we believe that the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from operating expenses is not material at this time as the related costs accounted for 3% of our total operating expenses.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: This text discusses the market risks associated with the company's long-term Credit Facility, which bears a variable interest rate.

{"section": "Item 3.. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, is routinely a party to pending or threatened litigation in the normal course of its business. Based upon information presently available, in view of legal and other defenses available to the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, management does not believe that any pending or threatened litigation or disputes will have any material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nOn January 6, 2000, the Company acquired (i) the stock of L&W Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, RCA Syndicate #1, Ltd., an Illinois licensed insurance carrier operating on the INEX (formerly the Illinois Insurance Exchange), (ii) the stock of Principal\nManagement, Inc., an insurance program development and management company headquartered in Okemos, Michigan, and in a related transaction, the Company also acquired (iii) the stock of Pegasus Insurance, a Cayman Islands licensed insurance carrier. The transactions were structured as stock acquisitions, with the purchase price payable by the Company consisting of $3,500,000 plus 200,000 American Safety common shares and earnout provisions for up to an additional 254,000 American Safety common shares over a five-year period. Of the purchase price, $1,000,000 of cash and 109,086 shares of stock are held in escrow to secure the obligations of the sellers.\nWhen RCA Syndicate #1, Ltd. filed its 1999 Annual Statement with the Illinois Department of Insurance in March 2000, the Company first became aware that there had been a material adverse change in the business affairs and financial condition of the acquired companies from that represented by the sellers. The Company launched an investigation which disclosed that the insurance claims experience of the acquired companies had been misrepresented and that incurred losses from insurance claims were significantly in excess of the amounts reported in their claims records and their financial statements. As a result, the Company then made written demand upon the selling shareholders of the acquired companies for rescission of the acquisitions, including a return of the purchase price paid for the companies. The Company filed a lawsuit on April 21, 2000 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to rescind the acquisitions based upon the sellers\u2019 breach of the representations and warranties made concerning the business affairs and financial condition of the acquired companies. The sellers\u2019 misrepresentations as to the business affairs and financial condition of the acquired companies, and the under-reserving for claims, relate only to the operations of the acquired companies.

Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, and a variety of claims arising in connection with the services, such as claims alleging defamation or invasion of privacy. In addition, from time to time, third parties assert patent infringement claims against the Company in the form of letters, lawsuits and other forms of communication. Currently, the Company is engaged in two lawsuits regarding patent issues.\nIn July 1999, IP Learn LLC filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint, which was amended by the plaintiff, alleged that aspects of the Company's technology infringed three patents alleged to be held by the plaintiff. The Company settled this lawsuit in February 2001, and an Order of Dismissal with Prejudice was entered by the Court on February 20, 2001.\nOn December 16, 1999, Patrick H.

Ask Jeeves, Inc., Case No. 99GV12584 MLW), alleging infringement by us of United States Patent Nos. 5,309,359 and 5,404,295 that are alleged to be held by the plaintiffs. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages, including attorneys' fees. We filed an answer to the complaint and a counterclaim for declaratory relief on January 28, 2000. The answer denies the\nallegations made in the complaint and seeks a dismissal of the complaint, invalidation of the asserted patents and an award to us of our costs, including attorneys' fees. The parties are in the discovery process in this litigation.\nWe intend to vigorously defend against the allegations asserted in this complaint and we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims. The results of any litigation matter are inherently uncertain. In the event of an adverse result in this lawsuit, or in any other litigation with third parties that could arise in the future with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products or services, we could be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed, to cease the use of infringing products or services, to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or to attempt to obtain licenses to the infringing technology on commercially reasonable terms.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nBecause of the short-term nature of the bank deposit arrangements and the very low interest rates prevailing in the United Kingdom and the United States, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations. We do not believe that our cash or cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity.\nWe invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy. The primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve capital, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields. We place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions, commercial companies, and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. Some of the securities we invest in may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate.\nOur investment exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our portfolio, changes in the market value due to changes in interest rates and other market factors as well as the increase or decrease in any realized gains and losses. Our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity. An increase or decrease in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our operating results, financial position or cash flows will be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates. However, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or other factors, such as changes in credit risk related to the securities\u2019 issuers. To minimize this risk, we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs, thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date. Accordingly, we do not believe that we have material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments. We have not realized any significant losses from our investments.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe maintain cash balances primarily in both USD and GBP to fund ongoing operations and manage foreign exchange risk. Cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of April 30, 2019 was composed of $32 million in cash and cash equivalents which consisted of readily available checking and bank deposit accounts held primarily in both USD and GBP and $68.8 million of marketable securities. As of April 30, 2019, 88% of cash and cash equivalents were held in USD and 12% in GBP. We currently incur significant expense primarily in GBP and convert USD as needed to fund those expenses. We do not currently engage in exchange rate hedging or other similar activities to address our exchange rate risk. A 10% change in the exchange rate would result in an immaterial net gain or loss.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation and changing prices had a significant impact on the results of operations for any periods presented herein.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: The company does not have significant exposure to market risk due to its short-term nature of bank deposit arrangements and low interest rates.

Dr. Rice is currently a Vice President of the Company, and served as a director of the Company from July 1999 to January 2001. The suit alleges that Convergence's corporate predecessor which was merged into Convergence, through Dr. Rice, used intellectual property of CNI and requests unspecified damages and a permanent injunction against Dr. Rice and Convergence from using or disclosing any intellectual property developed in whole or in part by Dr. Rice while he was employed by CNI. The Company believes there are meritorious defenses to the claims and intends to defend against the lawsuit vigorously. In addition, the Company believes that the Company and Convergence are entitled to indemnification for damages from certain stockholders of Convergence's predecessor, costs and expenses arising out of this lawsuit up to $10.0 million under the agreement relating to the acquisition of Convergence's predecessor.\nAdditionally, the Company entered into Stock Escrow and Pledge Agreements (the Agreements) with Dr. Rice and other stockholders of Convergence's predecessor to secure the indemnity obligations under the agreement relating to the acquisition of Convergence's predecessor as they may relate to the CPI lawsuit. The Agreements required that 312,500 shares of common stock that were issued upon achieving a milestone be placed in escrow, and that a security interest in the stock be granted to the Company. These shares may be released from escrow and replaced with cash deposited in escrow in total, or in part, using an amount calculated in accordance with the Agreements.

Pegaso reports its results in Mexican pesos. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso may affect our results of operations as well as the value of our ownership interest in Pegaso. Generally, Pegaso generates revenues that are paid in Mexican pesos, but its major contracts, including financing agreements and contracts with equipment suppliers, are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, a significant change in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso could result in a significant increase in its expenses and could have a material adverse effect on Pegaso and on us. In some emerging markets, including Mexico, significant devaluations of the local currency have occurred and may occur again in the future.\nLeap has accrued for taxes payable to the Chilean government denominated in Chilean pesos related to its June 2000 sale of Smartcom. This liability is subject to the effects of currency fluctuations that may affect reported earnings and losses. A significant depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Chilean peso could result in a significant increase in our consolidated expenses. As of December 31, 2000, this liability amounted to approximately $29.7 million. Our results of operations would be negatively impacted by approximately $3.3 million if the U.S. dollar was to depreciate against the Chilean peso by 10%. This hypothetical amount is only suggestive of the effect of currency fluctuations on our results of operations. This liability is due and payable by no later than April 2001.\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate long-term debt obligations. The general level of U.S. interest rates and/or LIBOR affect the\ninterest expense that we recognize on our variable rate long-term debt obligations. As of December 31, 2000, the principal amounts of our variable rate long-term debt obligations amounted to approximately $377.6 million. An increase of 10% in interest rates would increase our interest expense for the year 2001 by approximately $4.1 million. This hypothetical amount is only suggestive of the effect of changes in interest rates on our results of operations for the year 2001.\nHedging Policy. As required by our vendor loan agreements, Leap will maintain hedging agreements which fix or limit the interest cost to Cricket Communications and the Leap subsidiaries that guarantee the vendor loans (other than Cricket Communications Holdings, Inc.) to a portion of their long-term indebtedness sufficient to cause 50% of their consolidated long-term indebtedness to be comprised of a combination of (a) indebtedness bearing interest at a fixed rate and (b) indebtedness covered by such hedging agreements. Other than this, Leap does not have a policy to systematically hedge against foreign currency exchange rate or interest rate risks.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nLeap has exposure to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect the value of Leap's ownership interest in Pegaso, while interest rate fluctuations may affect Leap's variable rate long-term debt obligations. Leap has a hedging policy to limit the interest cost of its vendor loan agreements, but does not have a policy to systematically hedge against foreign currency exchange rate or interest rate risks."}

Blackbeard Operating, LLC, et.al, No. 18-10-24761 - CVW in the 143rd District Court in Ward County, Texas (the \u201c2018 Litigation\u201d) was filed, naming, among others, Boaz Energy and the Trust as defendants. The plaintiff is a lessor under two leases operated by Blackbeard Operating LLC. The Underlying Properties include the interests of Boaz Energy in some of the minerals covered by those leases. The litigation seeks surface use damages and alleges violations of the terms of the leases, among other things. While it is not yet possible to estimate any potential loss or range of loss, Boaz Energy has advised the Trustee that it does not anticipate the litigation will materially affect the Trust. On January 3, 2020, Lawrence M. Marston joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff alleging surface damage claims against Blackbeard and Goodnight Midstream Permian, L.L.C., but not against the Trust. On January 17, 2020, the Trust and the other defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which would dispose of the claims against the Trust if granted. After delays related to COVID-19, a hearing on the summary judgment motions filed by the Defendants and Goodnight was held on August 27, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, the court had not yet ruled on the motion for summary judgment. A mediation was conducted on November 10, 2020, but no settlement was reached. The discovery period closed in January 2021. Counsel for the defendants reported that during discovery, plaintiffs appeared to concede several points related to their claim against the Trust in responses to request for disclosure and a deposition of the Marston Trust\u2019s manager, including that the Trust and the other defendants are entitled to retain 40-acres around each producing well as defendants have contended all along. However, plaintiffs have not formally amended their pleading or otherwise non-suited any claim against the Trust. Consequently, the Trust and the other defendants filed a second summary judgment motion pointing out, in part, that plaintiffs appear to have conceded portions of their claim against the Trust and the other defendants regarding the trespass to try title claim. That motion is set for hearing on April 1, 2021. Trial is presently set for May 3, 2021. The parties are presently engaged in pre-trial preparation with pre-trial exchange deadlines of March 26, 2021, and April 16, 2021, and preparing for the April 1, 2021 summary judgment hearing.\nItem 4.", "summary": "The 2018 Litigation was filed on October 1, 2018, by Thaleia L.

{"section": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRG&E is exposed to interest rate and commodity price risks.\nThe interest rate risk relates to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including maturing debt securities, and to variable rate debt. RG&E manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed -rate debt with varying maturities and through economic refundings of debt through optional redemptions. A portion of RG&E's long-term debt consists of long-term Promissory Notes, the interest component of which resets on a periodic basis reflecting current market conditions. See \"Note 6 - Long Term Debt\". RG&E was not participating in any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk as of December 31, 2000 or December 31, 1999.\nThe commodity price risk relates to market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, electricity, and other petroleum-related products used for resale. Commodity purchases and electric generation are based on projected demand for power generation and customer delivery of electricity, natural gas, and petroleum products. RG&E enters into forward contracts for natural gas to hedge the effect of price increases and reduce volatility on gas purchased for resale. Owned electric generation significantly reduces RG&E's exposure to market fluctuations in electric prices. RG&E does not hold open speculative positions in any commodity for trading purposes.\nRG&E's exposure to market price fluctuations of the cost of natural gas is further limited as the result of the Gas Cost Adjustment (GCA), a regulatory mechanism that transfers substantially all gas commodity price risk to the customer. Nonetheless, RG&E does hedge approximately 70% of its gas supply price through the purchase of derivative contracts and the use of storage assets. The balance of RG&E's natural gas requirements is procured through spot market purchases and is subject to market price fluctuations.\nUnder the Electric Settlement, RG&E's electric rates are capped at specified levels through June 30, 2002. As a result of owned generation and long-term fixed rate supply contracts, RG&E is largely insulated from market price fluctuations for procurement of its electric supply. In the event RG&E's generation assets fail to perform as planned, RG&E is exposed to market price fluctuations, and under the current rate agreement, fully absorbs this operating risk.\nEnergetix has entered into electric and natural gas purchase commitments with numerous suppliers. These commitments support fixed price offerings to retail electric and gas customers. Griffith is in the business of purchasing various petroleum-related commodities for resale to its customers. To manage the resulting market price risk, Griffith enters into various exchange-traded futures and option contracts and over-the-counter contracts with third parties. Through December 31, 2000, all hedge contracts have been accounted for under the deferral method with gains and losses from the hedging activity included in the cost of sales as inventories are sold or as the hedge transaction occurs. Commodity instruments not designated as effective hedges are marked to market at the end of the reporting period, with the resulting gains or losses recognized in cost of sales. These contracts are closely monitored on a daily basis to manage the price risk associated with inventory and future sales commitments. At December 31, 2000 and 1999 Griffith's net deferred gains on open hedge contracts were not significant.\nItem 8.", "summary": "RG&E is exposed to market risks related to interest rates and commodity prices. To manage interest rate risk, RG&E issues fixed-rate debt and performs economic refundings. To manage commodity price risk, RG&E enters into forward contracts for natural gas and has owned electric generation. Additionally, the Gas Cost Adjustment transfers most of the gas commodity price risk to customers. Energetix and Griffith manage their market price risk through exchange-traded futures and option contracts and over-the-counter contracts. Gains and losses from these contracts are recognized in cost of sales."}
{"section": "ITEM 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nIn October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) named JT Ryerson as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party (\u201cPRP\u201d) for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the \u201cPHS Site\u201d). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued an initial Record of Decision (\u201cROD\u201d) regarding the site. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping, and enhanced natural recovery that would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. In a change from its prior stance, at a meeting on December 4, 2018, the EPA indicated that it expected PRPs to submit a plan during 2019 to start remediation of the river and harbor per the original ROD within the next two to three years. The EPA also indicated that it expected allocation of amounts among the parties to be determined in the same two to three-year time frame. The EPA invited certain PRPs to a May 2, 2019 meeting to discuss starting the remedial design process. The EPA did not include JT Ryerson in those meetings.\nOn December 9, 2019, a PRP group met with Administrator Wheeler, the head of the EPA, to discuss updating the ROD as recent testing indicates that the levels of contamination have \u201cdrastically improved\u201d and, thus, remediation should be much less drastic than that in the current ROD. We have been informed that Administrator Wheeler is requiring regional EPA staff to engage in discussions with the PRP group before moving forward with any enforcement action. The EPA indicated in a January 2, 2020 \u201cprogress update\u201d letter that it is negotiating with certain parties to perform remedial design work at five unspecified areas which comprise 52% of the overall acreage subject to remediation. It is unclear if any of these areas include the areas where our former facilities were located. As a result of the ongoing negotiations over the ROD, the EPA\u2019s decision not to meet with smaller parties, and the December 9, 2019 meeting with Administrator Wheeler, the discussions with the EPA regarding remedial design appear to be delayed.\nThe EPA has stated that it is willing to consider de minimis settlements, which JT Ryerson is trying to pursue; however, the EPA has not begun meeting with any of the smaller parties who have requested de minimis or de micromis status, stating that it does not have sufficient information to determine whether any parties meet such criteria and does not intend to begin those considerations until after the remedial design work is completed. It has met with selected parties that we believe to be larger targets. JT Ryerson has not been invited to meet with the EPA.\nThe EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including JT Ryerson. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent JT Ryerson may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan\u2019s costs might ultimately be allocated to JT Ryerson. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.\nThere are various other claims and pending actions against the Company. The amount of liability, if any, for those claims and actions as of December 31, 2019 is not determinable but, in the opinion of management, such liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In January 2017, Areli Arellano and Joe L. Martinez joined the lawsuit as additional plaintiffs. The lawsuit alleges that we (but not Post Properties (see the description of the Brown class action lawsuit below)) charged late fees at our Texas properties that violate Section 92.019 of the Texas Property Code, or Section 92.019, which provides that a landlord may not charge a tenant a late fee for failing to pay rent unless, among other things, the fee is a reasonable estimate of uncertain damages to the landlord that are incapable of precise calculation and result from the late payment of rent.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe typically invest in a limited number of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in money market accounts, certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds with a typical long-term debt rating of \u201cA\u201d or better by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, denominated in U.S. dollars. All of our cash equivalents and investments are treated as \u201cheld-to-maturity.\u201d Investments in fixed-rate interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk as their market value may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. As a result, we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as \u201cheld-to-maturity\u201d based on our intent and ability to hold these instruments to maturity, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates. These securities are reported at amortized cost. Based on investment positions as of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $0.8 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAdditionally, we have access to a $50.0 million line of credit borrowing facility which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0 to 1.5% per year determined in accordance with a pricing grid based on our funded debt to EBITDA ratio. Under the terms of the line of credit, available borrowings are reduced by outstanding letters of credit, which totaled\n$2.7 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, there was no amount outstanding under the line of credit, and the available borrowing under the line of credit was $47.3 million. We have not borrowed any funds under the line of credit since its inception; however; should we need to do so in the future, such borrowings could be subject to adverse or favorable changes in the underlying interest rate.\nExchange Rate Risk\nOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in each case compared to the U.S. dollar, related to transactions by our foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our sales to international customers are transacted in U.S. dollars and therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions. However, the cost of our products to our customers increases when the U.S. dollar strengthens against their local currency, and we may have more sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies in future years which could increase our foreign exchange rate risk. Additionally, intercompany sales to our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international subsidiaries are transacted in U.S. dollars which could increase our foreign exchange rate risk caused by foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nTo date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities. However, we may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.

The applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 0.875% and for LIBOR borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.875% and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio. A change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instrument. We had $345.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest of 3.423% under the credit facility as of September 30, 2019.\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The primary objective of our derivative instruments is to protect the value of foreign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to conversion to their functional currencies. We principally utilize foreign currency forward contracts, which enable us to buy and sell foreign currencies in the future at fixed exchange rates and economically offset changes in foreign exchange rates. We routinely enter into contracts to offset exposures denominated in the British pound, Euro and Singapore dollar.\nForeign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances are remeasured at foreign exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates reported in other income (expense), net. The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through other income (expense), net. Fair value changes in the forward contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured receivable and cash balances attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are short-term in nature and typically have average maturities at inception of less than three months.\nThe following tables summarize our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts, by currency, at September 30, 2019 and 2018:\nThe foreign currency forward contracts were entered into on September 30 of each fiscal year; therefore, the fair value was $0 on September 30, 2019 and 2018.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk provides information about the market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We maintain an investment portfolio consisting of bank deposits and money market funds, and have a $400 million unsecured revolving line of credit, both of which may be subject to interest rate risk. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to manage risks caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of these contracts was $0 at September 30, 2019 and 2018."}
{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThe market risk inherent in the Company's market risk-sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Company's daily net commodity position consists of inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, exchange-traded futures, and over-the-counter contracts. The fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices. The Company has established controls to manage and limit risk exposure, which consists of a daily review of position limits and effects of potential market price moves on those positions.\nA sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Company's exposure to market risk of its net commodity futures position. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted market prices. The result of this analysis, which may differ from actual results, is as follows:\nForeign Currency\nThe Company has subsidiaries located outside the United States where the local currency is the functional currency. To reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in the British pound, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar. These currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur. The Company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange-traded futures contracts, and over-the-counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material.\nInterest Rates\nThe fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates and credit ratings for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Market risk, which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one-half percent decrease in interest rates, is summarized below:\nActual results may differ. The estimated fair value and market risk will vary from year to year depending on the total amount of long-term debt and the mix of variable and fixed rate debt.\nAdditionally, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time to manage our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt effectively which may decrease market risk noted above. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the impact of these hedging instruments.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nManagement of Market Risk\nGeneral. The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, WaterStone Bank\u2019s board of directors has established an Asset/Liability Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. Management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the Asset/Liability Committee meets at least weekly to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position, which are evaluated quarterly.\nWe have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: (i) emphasizing variable rate loans including variable rate one- to four-family, and commercial real estate loans as well as three to five year commercial real estate balloon loans; (ii) reducing and shortening the expected average life of the investment portfolio; and (iii) whenever possible, lengthening the term structure of our deposit base and our borrowings from the FHLBC. These measures should reduce the volatility of our net interest income in different interest rate environments.\nIncome\nSimulation. Simulation analysis is an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time. At least quarterly we review the potential effect changes in interest rates may have on the repayment or repricing of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities. Our most recent simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments. Prepayment rate assumptions may have a significant impact on interest income simulation results. Because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage-backed securities we hold, rising or falling interest rates may have a significant impact on the actual prepayment speeds of our mortgage related assets that may in turn affect our interest rate sensitivity position. When interest rates rise, prepayment speeds slow and the average expected lives of our assets would tend to lengthen more than the expected average lives of our liabilities and therefore would most likely have a positive impact on net interest income and earnings.\nThe following interest rate scenario displays the percentage change in net interest income over a one-year time horizon assuming increases of 100, 200 and 300 basis points and a decrease of 100 basis points. The results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet accounts following an instantaneous parallel change in market rates based upon a static (no growth balance sheet).\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income Sensitivity\nAt December 31, 2019, a 100 basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates had the effect of increasing forecast net interest income over the next 12 months by 2.03% while a 100 basis point decrease in rates had the effect of decreasing net interest income by 2.80%.\n- 51 -\nItem 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nWaterStone Bank has established an Asset/Liability Committee to manage its interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of its net interest income to changes in market interest rates.

Our New Senior Secured Credit Facility provides for variable rate borrowings of up to $1,239 million including $595 million under our New Revolving Credit Facility, net of $5 million of letters of credit. A one-eighth percent increase or decrease in assumed interest rates for the New Senior Secured Credit Facility, if fully drawn as of December 31, 2019, would have an impact of approximately $1 million on interest expense.

We believe other exposure to foreign currencies is immaterial.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are subject to changes in our cost of sales caused by movements in underlying commodity prices. Approximately 70% of our cost of sales consists of purchased components with significant raw material content. A substantial portion of the purchased parts are made of aluminum and steel. The cost of aluminum parts includes an adjustment factor on future purchases for fluctuations in aluminum prices based on accepted industry indices. In addition, a substantial amount of steel-based contracts also include an index-based component.

{"section": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings relating to claims associated with its properties, operations or business or arising from disputes with vendors in the normal course of business, including the material matters discussed below.\nOn November 16, 2010, a subsidiary of the Company, several predecessor operators and several product purchasers were named in a lawsuit filed in the District Court for Lavaca County in Texas by an entity alleging that it owns a working interest in two wells that has not been recognized by the Company or by predecessor operators to which the Company had granted indemnification rights. In dispute is whether ownership rights were transferred through a number of decades-old, poorly documented transactions. Based on prior summary judgments, the trial court entered a final judgment in the case in favor of the plaintiffs for approximately $5.3 million, plus post-judgment interest. The Company appealed the trial court\u2019s decision to the applicable state Court of Appeals, and in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Court of Appeals issued its opinion and affirmed the trial court\u2019s summary decision. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company filed a motion for rehearing with the Court of Appeals, which was denied, as expected. The Company filed a petition requesting a review by the Texas Supreme Court, as the Company believes the trial and appellate courts erred in the interpretation of the law. In early October 2019, the Texas Supreme Court notified the Company that it would not hear this case. The Company engaged additional legal representation to assist in the preparation of an amended petition requesting that the Texas Supreme Court reconsider its initial decision to not review the case. That amended petition was filed, and in mid-March 2020, the Texas Supreme Court decided they would not re-hear the case. Consequently, during the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $6.3 million liability for the judgment, interest and fees, with $3.5 million of such liability related to suspended funds currently reflected in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet.\nOn January 14, 2016, the Company was named as the defendant in a lawsuit filed in the District Court for Harris County in Texas by a third-party operator. The Company participated in the drilling of a well in 2012, which experienced serious difficulties during the initial drilling, which eventually led to the plugging and abandoning of the wellbore prior to reaching the target depth. In dispute is whether the Company is responsible for the additional costs related to the drilling difficulties and plugging and abandonment. In September 2019, the case went to trial, and, in October 2019, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. Prior to the judgment, the Company had approximately $1.1 million in accounts payable related to the disputed costs associated with this case. As a result of the judgment, during the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded an additional $2.1 million liability for the final judgment plus fees and interest. The Company has since prepared and filed an appeal with the appellate court for a review of the initial trial court decision and is awaiting the court\u2019s response.\nWhile many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty and the Company is unable at the date of this filing to estimate an amount of possible loss with respect to certain of these matters, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to these proceedings or claims will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations.

The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.\nPSE's objective is to minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios. It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. PSE hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.\nPSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools including a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE\u2019s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions.

The forward physical electric and natural gas contracts are both fixed and variable (at index). To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts.

We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing a mix of fixed and floating rate financings with staggered maturities and through interest rate protection agreements to fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal balance of our variable rate indebtedness was $321.6 million and consisted of mortgage loans and repurchase agreements.\nCertain of our mortgage loans and repurchase agreements are variable rate and indexed to the one-month U.S. dollar denominated LIBOR. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a 10% increase in the one-month U.S. dollar denominated LIBOR would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of $0.6 million.\nInvestments in Real Estate-Related Securities\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held $277.7 million of real estate-related securities. Our investments in real estate-related securities are primarily floating rate and indexed to one-month or three-month U.S. dollar denominated LIBOR and as such, are exposed to interest rate risk. Our net income will increase or decrease depending on interest rate movements. While we cannot predict factors that may or may not affect interest rates, for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 10% increase or decrease in the one-month U.S. dollar denominated LIBOR rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease to income from real estate-related securities of $0.2 million.\nWe may also be exposed to market risk with respect to our investments in real-estate related securities due to changes in the fair value of our investments. We seek to manage our exposure to market risk with respect to our investments in real estate-related securities by making investments in securities backed by different types of collateral and varying credit ratings. The fair value of our investments may fluctuate, thus the amount we will realize upon any sale of our investments is unknown. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value at which we may sell our investments in real estate-related securities is not known, but a 10% change in the fair value of our investments in real estate-related securities may result in an unrealized gain or loss of $27.8 million.\nLibor Transition Risk\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. There is currently no certainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate (although the secured overnight financing rate has been proposed as an alternative to U.S.-dollar LIBOR). As indicated in the Interest Rate Risk section above, a substantial portion of our loans, investment securities, borrowings and interest rate derivatives are indexed to LIBOR or similar reference rates. Market participants anticipate that financial instruments tied to LIBOR will require transition to an alternative reference rate if LIBOR is no longer available. Our LIBOR-based loan agreements and borrowing arrangements generally specify alternative reference rates such as the prime rate and federal funds rate, respectively. The potential effect of the discontinuation of LIBOR on our interest\nincome and expense cannot yet be determined and any changes to benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs and/or result in mismatches between the interest rates of our investments and the corresponding financings.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk associated with the company's variable-rate indebtedness, investments in real estate-related securities, and potential transition away from LIBOR.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our sales contracts are generally denominated in the local currency of the entity with which they are contracted. Our operating expenses are generally denominated in the local currencies of the countries where our operations are located. Most of our expenses are incurred in euros and U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar fluctuates against certain international currencies, the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we report in U.S. dollars for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies may also fluctuate relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 54% of our revenue and approximately 56% of aggregate cost of sales and operating expenses were generated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2018 approximately 57% of our revenue and approximately 58% of aggregate cost of sales and operating expenses were generated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We have not entered into derivatives or hedging transactions, as our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has historically been partially hedged as our euro denominated inflows have covered our euro denominated expenses and our USD denominated inflows have covered our USD denominated expenses. However, we may enter into derivative or hedging transactions in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the foreign exchange rate of the euro to the U.S. Dollar would have resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease of the consolidated net loss to the Company by approximately $3.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $177.1 million, $34.1 million, and $87.0 million at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents reasonably approximates fair value, as a result of the short maturities of investment instruments used. The primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of capital, and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Short-term and long-term investments we hold are in the form of term deposits with fixed interest rates, thereby limiting their exposure related to interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial statements during either of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIn September 2019, we issued \u20ac139.8 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due September 1, 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d). The 2024 Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 1.75% and, therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 2024 Notes. However, the fair value of the 2024 Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of the fixed interest rate 2024 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the 2024 Notes fluctuates when the market price of our ADSs fluctuate. We carry the 2024 Notes at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary:\nThe company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and inflation risk.

The Company was also named as a nominal defendant. The derivative complaint asserted claims under \u00a7\u00a710(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 and sought, among other things, injunctive relief, damages and costs. It alleged false or misleading statements and omissions in the Registration Statement filed by the Company in connection with its IPO and subsequent public filings and statements. The derivative complaint also asserted claims for purported breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, mismanagement and waste of corporate assets.\nOn December 18, 2019, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement to resolve and dismiss the Derivative Suit, and on January 2, 2020, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement set forth therein.

The complaint asserts that MPS ultra-secure gift card packages sold to at least one customer infringe a Company patent on ultra-secure gift card packages. MPS answered the complaint and counterclaimed for invalidity and non-infringement. The Company\u2019s preliminary injunction request was denied without prejudice after MPS represented that it had voluntarily ceased using the accused technology and will notify CPI before it re-starts. MPS\u2019s early motion for summary judgment was denied in August 2017 and its motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds was denied in July 2018. The Company\u2019s subsidiary CPI Card Group-Minnesota, Inc., has been added to the case as plaintiff. The Company\u2019s patent will expire in 2028.\nIn June 2017, MPS filed an Inter Partes Review (\u201cIPR\u201d) petition with the United States Patent & Trademark Office\u2019s Patent Trial & Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d) to review the patent at issue in the patent infringement suit. The PTAB instituted the IPR on January 9, 2018. The PTAB entered its final written decision on January 4, 2019, determining that all of the claims in the patent are unpatentable. The Company filed an appeal of this decision to the federal circuit court on March 1, 2019, and a hearing regarding the Company\u2019s appeal was held on March 3, 2020. The federal circuit court has not yet issued its decision regarding the Company\u2019s appeal. The patent infringement suit is administratively dismissed pending the final determination of the patent validity.\nIn addition to the matters described above, the Company is subject to routine legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to many market risk factors, including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates, as well as changes in the cost of raw materials. These risk factors may affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nWe manage these risks through regular operating and financing methods, including the use of derivative financial instruments. When we have derivative instruments, they are with major financial institutions and are not for speculative or trading purposes. Also, as part of our financial risk management, we regularly review significant contracts for embedded derivatives and, if identified, would record them in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nThe following analysis presents the effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at December 31, 2020. We analyzed only the potential impacts of our hypothetical assumptions. This analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total long-term debt of $599 million. All of the long-term debt is at fixed rates. There was no interest rate risk at the end of the year associated with the fixed rate debt.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding variable rate debt under our revolving credit facility. Therefore, we had no interest rate risk at the end of the year associated with the variable rate debt.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, holding all other variables constant, would have resulted in a change of $22 million in fair value of our debt at December 31, 2020.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign subsidiaries, as well as through export sales from the United States. These transactions are often denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our primary currency exposures are the European Union Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Singapore Dollar, Mexican Peso, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar. We may enter into forward contracts as hedges to minimize the fluctuation of intercompany accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding forward contracts.\nRaw Material Price Risk\nWe utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products, including base oil, polyisobutylene, antioxidants, alcohols, solvents, sulfonates, friction modifiers, olefins, and copolymers. We may also enter into contracts which commit us to purchase some of our more critical raw materials based on anticipated demand. Our profitability is sensitive to changes in the quantities of raw materials we may need and the costs of those materials which may be caused by changes in supply, demand or other market conditions, over which we have little or no control. In addition, political and economic conditions in certain regions of the world in which we operate have caused, and may continue to cause, our demand for and the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate. War, armed hostilities, terrorist acts, civil unrest, or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp change in our demand for and the cost of our raw materials. If we experience such increases in the cost of our raw materials, we may not be able to pass them along to our customers in the form of price increases for our products. The inability to do so would have a negative impact on our operating profit. In\naddition, if our demand for raw materials were to decline such that we would not have need for the quantities required to be purchased under commitment agreements, we could incur additional charges that would affect our profitability.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Summary:\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total long-term debt of $599 million, all of which was at fixed rates, and no outstanding variable rate debt under our revolving credit facility.

{"section": "Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business strategies, the primary market risk which we are exposed to is interest rate risk.\nLow to moderate levels of inflation during the past several years have favorably impacted our operations by stabilizing operating expenses. At the same time, low inflation has had the indirect effect of reducing our ability to increase tenant rents. However, our commercial leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation.\nThe market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. Of our long-term debt, which consists of secured financings, the 77 Greenwich Construction Facility bears interest on drawn amounts at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) LIBOR plus 8.25% and (ii) 9.25%, points, the 237 11th Loans bears interest at a blended average rate of approximately 3.72% over the 30-day LIBOR and the line of credit bears interest at 200 basis points over the 30-day LIBOR. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, caps, collars, and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We would not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our debt consisted of three variable-rate secured mortgage loans payable and a promissory note with aggregate carrying values of $173.4 million and a variable-rate secured line of credit with a balance of $5.3 million. Due to the short term maturities and floating rate nature of our debt obligations, their book values approximated their fair values at December 31, 2019. Changes in market interest rates on our variable-rate debt impacts the fair value of the loans and interest incurred or cash flow. For instance, if interest rates increase 100 basis points and our variable-rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise. The sensitivity analysis related to our variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2019 levels, with all other variables held constant and would result in a change in our interest expense by approximately $1.8 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rate changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure.\nAs of December 31, 2019 the debt on the unconsolidated joint venture, in which we hold a 50% interest, consisted of a variable-rate secured mortgage loan payable, with a carrying value of $42.5 million (see Note 13 - Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture to the consolidated financial statements for further information), which approximated its fair value at December 31, 2019. A 100 basis point change in market interest rates on the loan taken out by the unconsolidated joint venture would result in a change in its interest expense by approximately $0.4 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rate changes on borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in the capital structure of the joint venture.\nAs the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2019, it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date. The information represented herein has limited predictive value. Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK is a disclosure of the market risks associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, we generated 19% and 20%, respectively, of our revenues outside of the United States. We typically denominate our international sales in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds sterling. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is also the functional currency for our foreign operations. Where transactions may be denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies. We recorded exchange rate losses of approximately $605,000 and $486,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. We estimate that a 10% movement in foreign currency rates would have the effect of creating an exchange gain or loss of approximately $652,000 for fiscal 2020.\nInterest Rates and Other Market Risks. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio of trading investments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities. These instruments include, but are not limited to, money-market instruments, bank time deposits, and taxable and tax-advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations, municipalities, and national, state, and local government agencies. These instruments are denominated in U.S. dollars. The fair market value of our cash equivalents and investments increased 8% to approximately $90.1 million in fiscal 2020 from $83.8 million in the prior year.\nWe also hold cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the United States and foreign countries. These cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short-term time deposits of the local bank. Such operating cash balances held at banks outside the United States are denominated in the local currency and are nominal.\nMany of our investments carry a degree of interest rate risk. When interest rates fall, our income from investments in variable-rate securities declines. When interest rates rise, the fair market value of our investments in fixed-rate securities declines. In addition, our investments in equity securities are subject to stock market volatility. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities, which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. We attempt to mitigate risk by holding fixed-rate securities to maturity, but if our liquidity needs force us to sell fixed-rate securities prior to maturity, we may experience a loss of principal. We believe that a 10% fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nInflation. Although we cannot accurately determine the amounts attributable thereto, we have been affected by inflation through increased costs of employee compensation and other operational expenses. To the extent permitted by the marketplace for our products and services, we attempt to recover increases in costs by periodically increasing prices.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks faced by a company, including foreign currency, interest rates, and inflation.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT RISKS\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk, which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates. We do not believe that our exposure to market risks, which are primarily related to interest rate changes, is material.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe maintain certain debt instruments at a fixed rate whose fair value will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and market perception of our credit risk. The fair value of our debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018 approximated the book value.\nIn 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. The first swap agreement of $25 million expired on August 29, 2019, and under the second swap agreement, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.5% through August 29, 2024. This swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. It is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedging instrument and is highly effective. Unrealized losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) and are recognized in income as an increase or decrease to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense.\nOur Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus 1.375% to a maximum of LIBOR plus 2.00%. As a result of the interest rate swap agreement, we are subject to interest rate risk on debt in excess of $25 million drawn on our Credit Facility. At December 31, 2019, we had an outstanding balance of $157 million. A 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe operate in a number of international areas which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We do not currently hold or issue forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes (a foreign exchange contract is an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate). Foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar (\"USD\") against foreign currencies and are included in other (income) expense in the statements of operations. We recognized foreign exchange losses in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency, as well as in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency. We recognized foreign exchange gains in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency, as well as in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency.\nCredit Risk\nOur financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Substantially all cash and cash equivalents are on deposit at commercial banks or investment firms. Our trade receivables are with a variety of domestic, international and national oil and gas companies. Management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the creditworthiness and financial resources of these financial institutions and companies.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the risks associated with the company's operations.

Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, and the company does not believe its exposure to this risk is material.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nBecause a portion of the Company\u2019s net revenues are derived from its operations outside the U.S. and are denominated in\nlocal currencies, the Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company\u2019s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s reported revenues, expenses, earnings, assets and liabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 22% of the Company\u2019s revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations transact business in their functional currency, which is the same as their local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the Canadian dollar, British pound, Euro, and Australian dollar have an impact on the Company\u2019s reported results. Under GAAP, revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. markets, the Company\u2019s reported results vary.\nDuring 2019, the U.S. dollar fluctuated, but generally strengthened, against the primary currencies in which the Company conducts business, compared to one year ago. Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported service revenues by $62.8 million, or 1.1%, in 2019 compared to prior year. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the Company\u2019s foreign operations. Because substantially all of the Company\u2019s foreign operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency, the effect of lower reported revenues is largely offset by the decrease in reported operating expenses. Reported net income was $2.5 million, or 0.6%, lower in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to prior year due to the effect of currency exchange rates.\nFor the one month ended January 31, 2020, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar since December 31, 2019. If currency exchange rates were to remain at January 2020 levels throughout 2020, the Company\u2019s 2020 full-year reported revenues would be impacted unfavorably, mostly offset by a favorable impact to operating expenses. Thus, the impact to reported net income would likely be immaterial.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity. The assets and liabilities of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Although currency fluctuations impact the Company\u2019s reported results and shareholders\u2019 equity, such fluctuations generally do not affect cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses. The Company generally has few cross-border transfers of funds, except for transfers to the U.S. for payment of intercompany loans, working capital loans made between the U.S. and the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries, and dividends from the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

We consider AAA locations to be highly desirable for tenancy by life science, technology, and agtech entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space. Founded in 1994, Alexandria pioneered this niche and has since established a significant market presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle.\nAlexandria develops dynamic urban cluster campuses and vibrant ecosystems that enable and inspire the world\u2019s most brilliant minds and innovative companies to create life-changing scientific and technological breakthroughs. We believe in the utmost professionalism, humility, and teamwork.

Alexandria also provides strategic risk capital to transformative life science, technology, and agtech companies through its venture capital arm. We believe our unique business model and diligent underwriting ensure a high-quality and diverse tenant base that should result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Alexandria\u2019s total market capitalization was $26.3 billion and our asset base in North America consisted of 39.2 million SF. The asset base in North America includes 27.0 million RSF of operating properties and 2.1 million RSF of Class A properties undergoing construction, 6.3 million RSF of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, and 3.8 million SF of future development projects.

Based on our current and expected levels of exposed liabilities, management estimates that a one percentage point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations for fiscal 2020.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies primarily related to our manufacturing facilities in Mexico, our wholesale and retail businesses in Canada, our wholesale business in the United Kingdom, and our majority-owned joint ventures in Thailand. In Mexico, we pay wages and other local expenses in Mexican Pesos. In our Canadian wholesale business, we pay wages and other local expenses in Canadian Dollars.

{"section": "Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nIt is anticipated that the Company will operate at a loss for the next twelve months. The Company anticipates continued reliance on financial assistance from affiliates. Given the current lack of capital, the Company has not been able to develop any new programs to revitalize the League, nor has it been able to hire sales and promotional personnel or schedule a season. As a result, the Company is currently dependent on the efforts of Daniel Meisenheimer, III and one other employee for all marketing efforts. Their efforts have not resulted in any franchises.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generally uses the accrual method of accounting. However, due to the uncertainty of collecting royalty and franchise fees from the franchisees, the USBL recorded these revenues upon receipt of cash consideration paid or the performance of related services by the franchisee. Franchise fees earned in nonmonetary transactions were recorded at the fair value of the franchise granted or the service received, based on which value is more readily determinable. Upon the granting of the franchise, the Company had performed essentially all material conditions related to the sale.\nFiscal Year 2018 Compared To Fiscal Year 2017\nFor the years ended February 28, 2019 (\"Fiscal 2019\") and February 28, 2018 (\u201cFiscal 2018\u201d), the Company had no franchise fees or advertising revenues as a result of the cancellation of its seasons since 2008.\nOperating expenses increased $11,418 from $48,965 in Fiscal 2018 to $60,383 in Fiscal 2019. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher professional fees $(8,302) and higher transfer agent and EDGAR agent fees $(1,686) in 2019 compared to 2018.\nOther expenses, net, decreased $2,768 from $(3,530) in Fiscal 2018 to $(762) in Fiscal 2019.\nNet loss increased $8,650 from $(52,495) in Fiscal 2018 to $(61,145) in Fiscal 2019, due primarily to higher operating expenses of $11,418.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had a working capital deficit of $2,367,937 at February 28, 2019. The Company's Fiscal 2019 statement of cash flows reflects net cash used in operating activities of $40,285, which is due primarily to the $61,145 net loss offset by the $19,993 increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash provided by financing activities was $40,250, which is due to the net increase in amounts due to related parties.\nThe Company expects it will again have to rely on affiliates for loans to assist it in meeting its current obligations. With respect to long term needs, the Company recognizes that in order for the League and USBL to be successful, USBL has to develop a meaningful sales and promotional program. This will require an investment of additional capital. Given the Company's current financial condition, the ability of the Company to raise additional capital other than from affiliates is questionable. At the current time the Company has no definitive plan as to how to raise additional capital and schedule a 2020 season.\nAs indicated in the report of the independent registered public accounting firm, the financial statements referred to above have been prepared for the Company assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company\u2019s present financial situation raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 1.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks, including, but not limited to, interest rates, energy commodity price volatility, and credit exposure. Management has established comprehensive risk management policies and procedures to manage these market risks.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. We manage our interest rate risk by issuing primarily fixed-rate long-term debt with varying maturities, refinancing certain debt and, at times, hedging the interest rate on anticipated borrowings. All of our debt has fixed interest rates, with the exception of our revolving credit facilities. The $400 million revolving credit facility bears interest at the lower of prime plus a credit spread, ranging from 0.00% to 0.75%, or available rates tied to the Eurodollar rate plus a credit spread, ranging from 0.88% to 1.75%. In addition, we have a $25 million revolving credit facility to provide swingline borrowing capability. The $25 million revolving credit facility bears interest at the lower of prime plus a credit spread of 0.13%, or available rates tied to the Eurodollar rate plus a credit spread of 0.65%. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $289 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.9 million.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk due to our reliance on market purchases to fulfill a portion of our electric and natural gas supply requirements. We also participate in the wholesale electric market to balance our supply of power from our own generating resources. Several factors influence price levels and volatility. These factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within regions, transportation availability and reliability within and between regions, fuel availability, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations.\nAs part of our overall strategy for fulfilling our electric and natural gas supply requirements, we employ the use of market purchases and sales, including forward contracts. These types of contracts are included in our supply portfolios and in some instances, are used to manage price volatility risk by taking advantage of seasonal fluctuations in market prices. These contracts are part of an overall portfolio approach intended to provide price stability for consumers. As a regulated utility, our exposure to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices is mitigated because these commodity costs are included in our Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska cost tracking mechanisms and are recoverable from customers subject to a regulatory review for prudency and, in Montana, a sharing mechanism.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk related to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations, and the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. If counterparties seek financial protection under bankruptcy laws, we are exposed to greater financial risks. We are also exposed to counterparty credit risk related to providing transmission service to our customers under our Open Access Transmission Tariff and under gas transportation agreements. We have risk management policies in place to limit our transactions to high quality counterparties. We monitor closely the status of our counterparties and take action, as appropriate, to further manage this risk. This includes, but is not limited to, requiring letters of credit or prepayment terms.

{"section": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide information required by this item.\nHowever, the Company notes that we are unable to predict the extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and is significantly impacting worldwide economic activity and increasing economic uncertainty. Many of our customers are currently or may become impacted by recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state, and local authorities to stay home (\"shelter in place\" or \"safer at home\"). These events have caused a significant increase in unemployment, are expected to result in decreased consumer spending and could cause economic deterioration. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding shelter in place orders have adversely affected our business in a number of ways, including a decreased demand for our products. This crisis has left some of our customers unable to make payments and has resulted in increased delinquencies and may cause other unpredictable and adverse events. If the pandemic continues, or if shelter in place orders are lifted and then another outbreak occurs, there may be continued or heightened impact on demand for our coffee and on our customers\u2019 ability to make payments.\nThe majority of our retail customer\u2019s businesses remain open subject to local social distancing orders. If one or more of our customer\u2019s businesses becomes unavailable, our ability to attract new customers, conduct business and collect payments from customers may be adversely affected, which could result in increased delinquencies and losses. In addition, changes in consumer behavior and health concerns may continue to impact demand for our coffees. We are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be deemed to be adequate or appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employee\u2019s ability to provide customer support and service.\nSome of our employees are subject to shelter-in-place requirements which have resulted in certain team members working remotely. Our roastery in Fort Bragg California remains fully operational subject to social distancing orders.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe primary source of market risk for us includes fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. All of our financial instruments are for purposes other than trading.\nInterest Rate Risk. On March 31, 2019, we did not have an outstanding loan balance on our credit agreement.\nCredit Risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by other parties of their contractual obligations. Our primary credit risk is related to oil and gas production sold to various purchasers and the receivables are generally not collateralized. At March 31, 2019, our largest credit risk associated with any single purchaser was $138,508 or 40% of our total oil and gas receivables. We have not experienced any significant credit losses.\nEnergy Price Risk. Our most significant market risk is the pricing for natural gas and crude oil. Our financial condition, results of operations, and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. We cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices with any certainty. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.\nPrices for crude oil and natural gas have been adversely effected by temporary pipeline capacity constraints primarily in the Permian Basin. We are unable to predict exactly how long this limitation will continue.\nFactors that can cause price fluctuations include the level of global demand for petroleum products, foreign and domestic supply of oil and gas, the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil-exporting countries, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall political and economic conditions in oil producing countries.\nDeclines in oil and natural gas prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Changes in oil and gas prices impact both estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves. Any reduction in reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations, can reduce the borrowing base under our credit facility and adversely affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to obtain additional capital for our acquisition, exploration and development activities. In addition, a noncash write-down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if prices declined significantly, even if it is only for a short period of time. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Ceiling Test under Item 7 of this report on Form 10-K. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that can be produced economically. Thus, we may experience material increases or decreases in reserve quantities solely as a result of price changes and not as a result of drilling or well performance.\nSimilarly, any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources. Oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. If the average oil price had increased or decreased by five dollars per barrel for fiscal 2019, our oil and gas revenue would have changed by $176,785. If the average gas price had increased or decreased by one dollar per mcf for fiscal 2019, oil and gas revenue would have changed by $295,133.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the primary sources of market risk for a company, which include fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The primary market risks that we are currently exposed to are real estate risk and interest rate risk. A substantial portion of our investments are, and we expect will continue to be, comprised of SFR properties. The primary driver of the value of this asset class is the fair value of the underlying real estate.\nReal Estate Risk\nResidential property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing); construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. Although decreases in property values may allow us to acquire additional homes with more attractive yields, such decreases could lead to increased unit turnover as more tenants may choose to purchase their own home or difficulties in refinancing, including our ability to finance existing collateral at the same level of funding or at the existing rate.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe will be exposed to interest rate risk from our debt financing activities. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. Changes in interest rates may affect our financing interest rate expense.\nWe have undertaken and may continue to undertake risk mitigation activities with respect to our debt financing interest rate obligations. A portion of our debt financing is, and will likely continue to be, based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over the relevant index, as determined by the particular financing arrangement. A significantly rising interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on the cost of such financing. To mitigate this risk, we have used, and may continue to use, derivative financial instruments such as interest rate caps in an effort to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in the interest rates we pay on our debt.\nThese derivative transactions have been and will continue to be entered into solely for risk management purposes, not for investment purposes. When undertaken, these derivative instruments likely will expose us to certain risks such as price and interest rate fluctuations, timing risk, volatility risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and changes in the liquidity of markets. Therefore, although we expect to transact in these derivative instruments purely for risk management, they may not adequately protect us from fluctuations in our financing interest rate obligations.\nWe have entered into multiple interest rate caps in order to manage the economic risk of increases in the floating rate portion of our variable rate debt. We will be reimbursed by the counterparties of the interest rate caps to the extent that the one-month LIBOR exceeds the applicable strike rate based on the scheduled notional amount. We are also exposed to counterparty risk should any of the counterparties fail to meet their obligations under the terms of the agreement.\nWe currently borrow funds on our repurchase and loan facilities at variable rates. At December 31, 2019, we had $142.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding that was not protected by interest rate hedge contracts and $677.4 million that was protected by interest rate caps. The estimated aggregate fair market value of this variable rate debt was $816.4 million. If the weighted\n(table of contents)\naverage interest rate on this variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher or lower, the annual interest expense would increase by $5.1 million or decrease by $8.2 million, respectively.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A. of the text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, including real estate risk and interest rate risk.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nHEDGES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into and may in the future enter into arrangements to hedge our oil and natural gas production, whereby gains and losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity. The hedges that we have entered into generally provide a 'floor' or 'cap and floor' on the prices paid for our oil and natural gas production over a period of time. Hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including the following:\no our production does not meet the minimum production requirements under the agreement;\no the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations; or\no there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received.\nDue to our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, we believe that the use of such derivative instruments does not expose us to material risk, however, the use of derivative instruments for the hedging activities could affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. The use of such instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, but it may also limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements.\nOur hedging strategy is designed to provide protection from low commodity prices while providing some opportunity to enjoy the benefits of higher commodity prices. We have a series of natural gas futures contracts with Bank of Montreal and with an affiliate of Enron. This strategy is designed to provide a degree of protection of negative shifts in natural gas prices as reported on the Henry Hub Nymex Index on approximately 73% of our expected natural gas production from reserves currently classified as proved developed producing during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001. At the same time, we are able to participate completely in upward movements in the Henry Hub Nymex Index to the extent of approximately 76% of our expected natural gas production for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001.\nIn addition to our natural gas hedging agreements, at June 30, 2000, we have a contract on 5,000 barrels of oil per month involving floor and ceiling prices of $22.00 and $28.63 per barrel, respectively, from July 1 through December 31, 2000.\nAs of June 30, 2000 the fair value of our hedging contracts, measured as the estimated cost we would incur to terminate the arrangements, was $5.3 million. As of June 30, 2000 a 10% increase in oil and natural gas prices would have resulted in an unfavorable change of $2.0 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts and a 10% decrease in oil and natural gas prices would have resulted in a favorable change of $2.1 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts.\nINTEREST RATES\nAt June 30, 2000, our exposure to interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement. As of June 30, 2000, we are not using any derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Interest is payable on borrowings under the credit agreement based on a floating rate. If short-term interest rates average 10% higher during our fiscal year 2001 than they were during 2000, our interest expense would increase by approximately $213,000. This amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change of 10% to our outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement at June 30, 2000.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the hedging strategies used by a company to reduce their exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas.

Accordingly, the Company has entered into an interest rate swap instruments. As a result, future fluctuations in LIBOR interest rates will result in the recording of unrealized gains and losses on interest rate derivatives held by the Company. The combined notional values were $460.6 million as of December 31, 2019. See Note H in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting treatment for these hedging transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has $213.5 million of fixed interest rate convertible debt and $1,259.2 million of variable interest rate debt outstanding. Variable interest rate debt exposes us to differences in future cash\nflows resulting from changes in market interest rates. Variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in annual cash flows resulting from a hypothetical 20% increase in interest rates. A hypothetical 20% increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a change in interest expense of approximately $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe convertible debt issued at fixed interest rates is exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates. Fixed interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the increase in fair value of our long term convertible debt through a hypothetical 20% increase in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, a 20% increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixed interest rate convertible debt by approximately $0.6 million.\nThe Company is exposed to concentration of credit risk primarily through cash deposits, cash equivalents, marketable securities and derivatives. As part of its risk management process, the Company monitors and evaluates the credit standing of the financial institutions with which it does business. The financial institutions with which it does business are generally highly rated. The Company is exposed to counterparty risk, which is the loss it could incur if a counterparty to a derivative contract defaulted.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company's liabilities reflected stock warrants issued to a customer. The fair value of the stock warrants obligation is re-measured at the end of each reporting period and marked to market. The fair value of the stock warrants is dependent on a number of factors which change, including the Company's common stock price, the volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock and the risk-free interest rate. See Note E in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about the fair value of the stock warrants\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare plans for certain eligible employees. The Company's related pension expense, plans' funded status, and funding requirements are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The funded status of the plans and the annual pension expense is recalculated at the beginning of each calendar year using the fair value of plan assets, market-based interest rates at that point in time, as well as assumptions for asset returns and other actuarial assumptions. Higher interest rates could result in a lower fair value of plan assets and increased pension expense in the following years. At December 31, 2019, ABX's defined benefit pension plans had total investment assets of $746.8 million under investment management. See Note J in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these assets.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk for changes in the price of jet fuel.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn May 2019, Theravance Biopharma, which is the owner of 85% of the economic interests in TRC, initiated arbitration against the Company and TRC, relating to a dispute as to the determination by Innoviva (as manager of TRC) to cause TRC to explore potential reinvestment opportunities for the royalty proceeds received by GSK into initiatives that Innoviva believes will increase the value of TRC and TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae. Theravance Biopharma alleged that, in causing TRC to not distribute substantially all royalty proceeds received from GSK, Innoviva breached the limited liability company operating agreement governing TRC (the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d), as well as the fiduciary duties applicable to Innoviva as manager of TRC. The hearing in respect of the arbitration was conducted from July 23, 2019 through July 25, 2019. Post-arbitration oral argument was heard on August 14, 2019. On September 26, 2019, the arbitrator issued a final decision. The arbitrator ruled that Innoviva did not breach the Operating Agreement or its fiduciary duties by withholding royalties or pursuing reinvestment opportunities. Accordingly, the Company is permitted to continue to pursue development and commercialization initiatives. The arbitrator did conclude that Innoviva breached a provision of the Operating Agreement requiring Innoviva to deliver quarterly financial plans to Theravance Biopharma. However, the arbitrator concluded that this technical breach did not cause any damages to Theravance Biopharma and the arbitrator awarded limited injunctive relief to expand and clarify the disclosure obligations under the Operating Agreement related to the delivery of financial plans and the pursuit of investment opportunities (if those opportunities related to TRELEGY\u00ae ELLIPTA\u00ae). Finally, the arbitrator ruled that the Company is entitled to indemnification from TRC for 95% of its fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration.\nOn September 30, 2019, the Company and TRC filed a Verified Complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (\u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) to confirm the arbitration award. The award was confirmed by the Court of Chancery on May 4, 2020.\nOn July 16, 2020, Innoviva and TRC initiated a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery against Theravance Biopharma, seeking a permanent injunction preventing Theravance Biopharma from interfering with Innoviva's ability to cause TRC to reserve cash to pursue non-Trelegy related investment opportunities and a declaration that the arbitration award conclusively established that Innoviva, as manager of TRC, has such authority. The Court of Chancery directed the parties to obtain the arbitrator's opinion as to whether the arbitration award addressed non-Trelegy related investment opportunities. On July 31, 2020, the arbitrator, while reiterating that Innoviva has broad authority as manager of TRC, found that his award did not specifically address this situation. Accordingly, on August 5, 2020, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the Court of Chancery action.\nOn October 6, 2020, Theravance Biopharma initiated a new arbitration against the Company and TRC, challenging Innoviva\u2019s authority as manager of TRC to cause TRC to pursue non-Trelegy related investment opportunities and again alleging that Innoviva is required to cause TRC to distribute substantially all royalty proceeds from GSK.

While the Failed Auction Security is Aaa/AA+ rated by major credit rating agencies,\ncollateralized by student loans and guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education under the Federal Family Education Loan Program, continued failure to sell at its periodic auction dates (i.e., reset dates) could negatively impact the carrying value of the investment, in turn leading to impairment charges in future periods.

We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nINTEREST RATE RISKS\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, which arises from the floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2000, we were obligated on $831 million of indebtedness carrying a floating interest rate. We enter into interest rate derivative agreements to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt.\nAs of December 31, 2000, we had one floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement which expires on June 3, 2004. The swap agreement effectively sets fixed rates on our floating rate debt in the range of 6.00% to 6.55%. Floating interest rates are based upon the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and the measurement and settlement is performed quarterly. Settlements of this agreement are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in the relevant periods. The notional amount related to this agreement was $575 million at December 31, 2000. In addition, we entered into a fixed-to-floating rate derivative with a notional amount of $250 million. Based on our currently hedged position, $825 million or 52% of our outstanding indebtedness is hedged.\nAt December 31, 2000, we had $831 million of floating rate debt of which $575 million was effectively converted to fixed rate debt by way of a swap. Additionally, we had $750 million of fixed rate debt at December 31, 2000 of which $250 million was converted to floating rate debt by way of a swap. Consequently, we had $506 million of floating rate debt at December 31, 2000 and a 1% increase in LIBOR rate would result in annualized interest expense of approximately $5.1 million.\nWe are also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred. As of December 31, 2000, we have senior subordinated notes totaling $300 million and $450 million expiring in the years 2005 and 2007, respectively. Based upon the quoted market price, the fair value of the notes was $692.0 million as of December 31, 2000. Generally, the fair market value of the notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall. We estimate that a 1% increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the notes by approximately $29.9 million as of December 31, 2000.\nEQUITY PUT OPTION DERIVATIVES\nWe are exposed to market risk relating to our equity put option derivative instrument. The contract terms relating to this instrument provide for settlement of 2.7 million options on July 2, 2001. The contract terms require us to make a settlement payment to the counterparties to this contract (payable in either cash or shares of our class A common stock) in an amount that is approximately equal to the put strike price of $28.931 minus the price of our class A common stock as of the termination date. This payment is limited by a strike price differential of $26.038 resulting in a maximum settlement of $2.893 per option.\nIf the put strike price is less than the price of our class A common stock as of the termination date, we would not be obligated to make a settlement payment. We would incur settlement costs of $7.8 million assuming a market price of $8.75 (the closing price on March 15, 2001). We would incur settlement costs of $7.8 million assuming a market price of $7.86 (the closing price on March 15, 2001, minus 10%).\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks associated with changes in interest rates and equity put option derivatives.

(formerly RMD Entertainment Group, Inc.), which may also be referred to we, us, our, or the Company, was organized on August 22, 2000 under the laws of the State of Nevada, as UgoMedia Interactive Corporation. We have gone through several changes in lines of business since our incorporation.\nOn October 17, 2009, we acquired Beijing Innotrek Technology Co. Ltd, a Chinese company based in Beijing, China (\u201cInnotrek\u201d). As a subsidiary of TechCom, Inc., Innotrek engaged in the research and development of broadband technology products in China. Innotrek specialized in high technology network communications and offered broadband technology installation services to hotels. Its products included (i) a system that makes use of various wired mediums, (ii) a cable modem and (iii) security and monitoring products. The company also distributed computers, network equipment, storage devices, and software products.\nOn June 30, 2017, the Company re-domiciled in Delaware and ceased being a Nevada corporation.\nPursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 6, 2017 and a Note Purchase Agreement dated October 11, 2017, Kok Seng Yeap obtained 1,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s convertible preferred stock and a convertible note in the amount of $50,000, the combination of which gave him a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Company.\nOn February 26, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with Delaware to change its name to TechCom, Inc. The Company is awaiting the approval of FINRA for the market effectiveness of the name change.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and as of December 31, 2019 a stockholders deficit of $159,297 with an accumulated deficit of $2,228,708. The Company intends to find a merger target in the form of an operating entity. The Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in this strategy.\nThese factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBusiness\nCurrently, we have no active operations.\nResearch and Development\nWe have not incurred any research and development costs in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 or 2019.\nEmployees\nAs of April 15, 2020, the Company has two officers: Mr. Kok Seng Yeap as Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Lau Chew Chye as Chief Financial Officer.\nInsurance\nWe do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to any action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have not obtained any copyrights, patents or trademarks. We do not anticipate filing any copyright or trademark applications related to any assets over the next 12 months.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals necessary to conduct our business; however, we will have to comply with all applicable export and import regulations.\nITEM 1A.", "summary": "TechCom, Inc.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS\nDiscussion in Item 7A relates solely to operations of Tengasco, Inc. and does not include discussion related to Riley operations.\nCommodity Risk\nThe Company\u2019s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production. Historically, prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue. Monthly oil price realizations during 2020 ranged from a low of $15.26 per barrel to a high of $53.04 per barrel. During 2020, the industry has seen a severe decline in oil commodity pricing from year-end 2019 pricing due to economic conditions worldwide caused by the novel virus outbreak which resulted in a significant decline in demand for oil, combined with an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia which further depressed crude oil pricing. The Company can operate in the short-term at these depressed levels, but would need to access additional capital should prices continue at these depressed level for an extended period of time.\nIn addition, during 2010, 2011, and 2012 the Company participated in derivative agreements on a specified number of barrels of oil of its production. The Company did not participate in any derivative agreements during 2020 or 2019 but may participate in derivative activities in the future.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had finance leases outstanding of approximately $77,000, and no amounts owed on its credit facility with Prosperity Bank. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate on the credit facility was variable at a rate equal to prime plus 0.50% per annum. The Company\u2019s credit facility interest rate at December 31, 2020 was 3.75%. The Company\u2019s finance leases of $77,000 has fixed interest rates ranging from approximately 5.0% to 6.5%.\nThe annual impact on interest expense and the Company\u2019s cash flows of a 10% increase in the interest rate on the credit facility would be approximately zero assuming borrowed amounts under the credit facility remained at the same amount owed as of December 31. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nForward-Looking Statements and Risk\nCertain statements in this Report including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company are forward-looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Company\u2019s control, and which would cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions, and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology, and other factors can also affect these risks. Additionally, fluctuations in oil and gas prices or prolonged periods of low prices may substantially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSee CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS on page 3.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Tengasco, Inc. is exposed to market risks related to the pricing of its oil and gas production, as well as interest rate risk related to its finance leases and credit facility. Prices for oil and gas production have been historically volatile and unpredictable, and the Company may participate in derivative activities in the future. The Company had finance leases and a credit facility with a variable interest rate at December 31, 2020, and a 10% increase in the interest rate would have a minimal impact on the Company's interest expense and cash flows. The Company is also exposed to risks related to the drilling of exploratory wells, lease and rig availability, and fluctuations in oil and gas prices."}
{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk using derivative financial instruments (forward contracts) as a risk management tool and not for speculative or trading purposes.\nWe use these foreign exchange contracts to reduce significant exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash flows resulting largely from the sale of products and services to non-U.S. customers will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These instruments allow us to reduce our overall exposure to exchange rates as the gains and losses on the contracts offset the losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and assets being hedged.\nAnnual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis, however, based on the changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and hedges.\nAt December 31, 2000, we had a total of $11.1 million in 30-day forward contracts. The US dollar equivalent balance at December 31, 2000 for each of the currencies held comprises: German Deutsche Marks ($1.8 million), British Pounds Sterling ($7.2 million), Netherland Guilders ($0.7 million), Italian Lire ($0.2 million) and Australian Dollar ($1.2 million). The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their respective fair values.\nWhile we hedge certain foreign currency transactions, the decline in value of non-U.S. dollar currencies may adversely impact our ability to contract for sales in U.S. dollars and our products and services may become more expensive to purchase in U.S. dollars for local customers doing business in the countries of the affected currencies.\nOur international business is also subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio, however our portfolio consists of only cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2000, and thus our interest rate risk is not material.\nWe are further subject to interest rate risk on our asset based loan facility, however we believe that the adverse movements of interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest rate fluctuation risk\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we invest our excess cash in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds and money market funds meeting certain criteria. These securities are classified as available-for-sale which are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. We have determined that the gross unrealized gains or losses on the available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2019 are temporary in nature. We may sell these marketable securities investments in the future to fund future operating needs.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $27.3 million outstanding under our U.S. credit facilities and $15.1 million outstanding under our term loans in Japan, which were subject to fluctuations in interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rate could result in $0.1 million additional annual interest expense. The hypothetical assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future. Furthermore, the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time. As a result, actual impacts on our results of operations in the future will differ from those quantified above.\nForeign currency exchange risk\nForeign currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation and may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statements of operations. A large portion of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries in China, whose functional currency is the RMB and Japan, whose functional currency is the JPY. To the extent that transactions by these subsidiaries are in currencies other than their functional currencies, we bear the risk that fluctuations in the exchange rates of the RMB and JPY in relation to other currencies could increase our costs and expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized net foreign currency transaction gain of $0.2 million. We use the U.S. dollar as the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements. Any significant revaluation of the RMB or JPY may materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations upon translation of these subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements into U.S. dollars. While we generate a significant portion of our revenue in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our cost of goods sold are in RMB. Therefore appreciation in RMB against the U.S. dollar would negatively impact our cost of goods sold upon translation to U.S. dollars. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 10% appreciation in RMB against the U.S. dollar would have resulted in an approximately $1.0 million increase in our cost of goods sold.\nIn July 2016, we commenced entering into hedging transactions to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Starting in the second half of 2018, we discontinued entering into foreign currency forward contracts. This may increase the risks to us arising from the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, our currency exchange variations may be magnified by any Chinese exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency.\nInflation risk\nInflationary factors, such as increases in our cost of goods sold and operating expenses, may adversely affect our results of operations. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, an increase in the rate of inflation in the future, particularly in China, may have an adverse effect on our levels of gross profit and operating profit as a percentage of revenue if the sales prices for our products do not proportionately increase with these increased expenses.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks associated with the company's investments, credit facilities, and foreign currency exchange. It states that a 10% increase in interest rates could result in an additional $0.1 million in annual interest expense, and a 10% appreciation of the RMB against the US dollar would result in an approximately $1.0 million increase in cost of goods sold. Inflationary factors may also have an adverse effect on the company's financial position and results of operations."}

The outcome of any such legal proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. In addition, litigation and related matters are costly and may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in other activities.

The panel instructed the parties to negotiate the terms of the Caribou Award, including Caribou\u2019s future payments to us for the same, but the parties\u2019 negotiations reached an impasse.\nOn February 6, 2020, after considering additional submissions from the parties, the panel clarified that the Caribou Award is limited to a particular on-going Caribou program, which seeks to develop a CAR-T product directed at CD19. The panel instructed the parties to seek to negotiate terms based on this scope. Accordingly, the Caribou Award will be subject to terms, including Caribou\u2019s future payments to us to be negotiated by the parties or, if unsuccessful, adjudicated in additional arbitration or judicial proceedings.\nPursuant to the September 2019 interim award, the Caribou Award by the panel does not include the structural guide modifications IP at issue in the arbitration, any other IP exclusively licensed or sublicensed by Caribou to us under the Caribou License (including but not limited to the foundational CRISPR/Cas9 IP co-owned by the Regents of the University of California, University of Vienna and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier), or any other of our IP.\nUpon, and subject to the terms of, a final award, which will follow further arbitration or legal proceedings, Caribou could be able to use the modified guide RNAs at issue for CAR-T cell human therapeutics directed at CD19. Either we or Caribou may challenge the arbitration panel\u2019s decisions under limited circumstances.\nOther than with regards to the technologies in dispute, the interim award has no effect on our rights or Caribou\u2019s obligations under the Caribou License.

The Company does not and currently does not intend to hedge exchange rate fluctuations between United States dollars and foreign currencies. However, from time to time, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate exposures. An instrument will be treated as a hedge if it is effective in offsetting the impact of volatility in the Company's underlying interest rate exposures. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.\nRevenue from international customers represented approximately 13% of 2000 net revenues. At December 31, 2000, there were no material non-United States dollar denominated financial instruments outstanding which exposed the Company to foreign exchange risk.\nAs noted above, the Company is exposed to market risk associated with adverse movements in interest rates. Specifically, the Company is primarily exposed to changes in the fair value of its $110 million senior subordinated notes, and to changes in earnings and related cash flows on its variable interest rate debt obligations outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility and its retained interests related to trade accounts receivable and equipment loans sold to the Company's special purpose finance subsidiaries. Borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility totaled $199.5 million at December 31, 2000.\nThe fair value of the Company's senior subordinated notes was approximately $82.5 million based upon prevailing prices in recent market transactions as of December 31, 2000. The Company\nestimates that this fair value would increase/decrease by approximately $5.7 million based upon an assumed 10% decrease/increase in interest rates compared with the effective yield on the senior subordinated notes as of December 31, 2000.\nAn assumed 10% increase/decrease in the variable interest rate of 9.2% in effect at December 31, 2000 related to the term loan borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility would decrease/increase annualized earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.9 million.\nEffective March 10, 1999, the Company entered into a $67 million interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution to hedge a portion of its interest rate risk related to its term loan borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. Under the swap, which has a term of three years, the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.962% and receives quarterly interest payments based upon LIBOR. The differential between the fixed and floating interest rates under the swap is accrued and is recorded as an adjustment of interest expense. The effect of this agreement on the Company's interest expense during 2000 was a reduction of $1.0 million. The fair value of this interest rate swap agreement which represents the amount that the Company would receive to settle the instrument is $0.7 million at December 31, 2000.\nAn assumed 10% increase/decrease in interest rates under the Asset Backed Facility at December 31, 2000 would not have a material effect on the fair value of the retained interest in sold trade accounts receivable due to the short-term nature of the underlying receivables. Finally, based upon the mix of variable and fixed rate equipment loans sold by the Company, a 10% increase/decrease in interest rates would decrease/increase the fair value of the Company's retained interests at December 31, 2000 of $21.4 million by less than $1.0 million.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.

Our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand.\nOur risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. Certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to \u201ctake or pay\u201d for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of generally up to 5 years for physical commodity requirements and commodity transportation requirements, with some extending beyond, and for up to 12 years for air products.

The complaints have all been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. They were filed as class actions on behalf of persons who purchased or acquired Cumulus Media common stock during various time periods between May 11, 1999 and April 24, 2000. On August 4, 2000, the eleven actions were consolidated into a single action, also pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On December 8, 2000, plaintiffs served a Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which alleges, among other things, violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated there under, and Sections 11 and 12(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks unspecified damages. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material facts concerning, among other things, the Company's financial condition as a result of the restatement on May 26, 2000 of the Company's results for the first three quarters of 1999. The plaintiffs further allege that because of the issuance of false and misleading statements and/or failure to disclose material facts, the price of Cumulus Media stock was artificially inflated. On February 8, 2001, the Company served its motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.\nIn 1999, the Company was served with a complaint filed in state court in New York, seeking approximately $1.9 million in damages arising from the Company's alleged breach of national representation agreements. To date, the Company has filed an answer to the complaint which denies liability and asserts a variety of affirmative defenses. On February 15, 2001, the Company's current national representation agent agreed to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company against any loss, liability, cost or expense in connection with this matter.\nIn 1999, the Company was served with a complaint filed in county court in Alabama alleging that in August 1997, an employee of Colonial Broadcasting, Inc., which we acquired in July 1998, was at fault in connection with an automobile accident. The plaintiff is seeking $8.5 million damages. We believe we have a right to indemnification from the sellers of Colonial Broadcasting under the related purchase agreement. The seller's insurance company has assumed the defense of the matter.\nIn addition, we currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK --------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe responsibility of monitoring and managing market and liquidity risk at Provident is assigned to the Asset Liability Committee (\"ALCO\"). The Market and Liquidity Risk Unit provides ALCO with the necessary analyses and reports. The main source of market risk is the risk of loss in the value of financial instruments that may result from the changes in interest rates. ALCO is bound to guidelines stated in the relevant policies approved by the Board of Directors.\nIn addition, ALCO is responsible for liquidity risk management. Provident offers a wide variety of retail deposit products to provide a stable funding source for loan growth. To supplement its retail deposits, Provident utilizes various sources of wholesale deposits. Borrowing through the Federal Home Loan Bank and offering short and medium term deposits to institutional investors are part of this strategy. Both asset securitizations treated as secured financings and those treated as sales provide funding for the origination of additional loans and leases. Through term and commercial paper conduit markets, Provident has the ability to take advantage of the liquid asset-backed securities market. In addition, in order to meet any unexpected changes in asset and liability positions, Provident maintains a liquid investment portfolio that may be used as a ready source of funds.\nInterest rate risk management guidelines and policies are approved by the Board of Directors. ALCO is responsible for monitoring and managing the interest rate risk of both the balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. The Market and Liquidity Risk Unit, as an extension of ALCO, utilizes asset/liability simulation to monitor interest rate risk. The simulation model measures the impact on net interest income due to changes in the yield curve, and performs stress tests on net interest income. The Interest Rate Risk Policy specifically states the boundaries for the percentage changes in net interest income. The Board of Directors also approves the limits for changes in the market value of equity. This is the change in the difference between the discounted value of assets and the discounted value of liabilities. The impairment or the improvement is measured as a percentage of total assets. Again, the Market and Liquidity Risk Unit monitors this ratio on a monthly basis.\nIn addition to natural balance sheet hedges, ALCO utilizes off-balance sheet instruments to manage interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps are the most widely used tool to manage interest rate risk, but from time to time, interest rate caps and floors may also be utilized. Provident has used off-balance sheet tools effectively for a number of years and has developed the necessary expertise and knowledge to achieve a safe and sound interest rate risk management process.\nPROVIDENT FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

The nature of our business results in us frequently becoming a party to judicial or administrative proceedings involving governmental authorities and other interested parties. At December 31, 2000, we were not involved in any such proceedings where we reasonably believe sanctions imposed by governmental authorities will exceed $100,000 or which we believe will have a material effect on our consolidated liquidity or results of operations. From time to time, we may also be subject to actions brought by citizens' groups, adjacent landowners or others in connection with the permitting and licensing of our landfills or transfer stations, or alleging personal injury, environmental damage or violations of the permits and licenses pursuant to which we operate.\nWe have been notified that we are considered a potentially responsible party at a number of sites under CERCLA or other environmental laws. In all cases, such alleged responsibility is due to the actions of companies acquired by Allied prior to their acquisition by Allied. We continually review our status with respect to each site, taking into account the alleged connection to the site and the extent of the contribution to the volume of waste at the site, the available evidence connecting the entity to that site and the number and financial soundness of other potentially responsible parties at the site. The ultimate amounts for environmental liabilities at sites where we may be a potentially responsible party cannot be determined and estimates of such liabilities made by us, after consultation with our independent environmental engineers, require assumptions about future events subject to a number of uncertainties, including the extent of the contamination, the appropriate remedy, the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties. Where we have concluded that our estimated share of potential liabilities is probable, a provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements. Since the ultimate outcome of these matters may differ from the estimates used in our assessments to date, the recorded liabilities are periodically evaluated, as additional information becomes available, to ascertain that the accrued liabilities are adequate. We have determined that the recorded liability for environmental matters as of December 31, 2000 of approximately $432.5 million represents the most probable outcome of these contingent matters.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. This market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes.\nThe following sections provide quantitative information on the Company\u2019s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and stock price risk. The Company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nThe Company conducts continuing operations in two principal currencies: the U.S. dollar, and the British pound sterling. These currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the Company\u2019s U.S., and UK operations. Cash is managed centrally within each of the two regions with net earnings invested in the U.S. and working capital requirements met from existing U.S. intercompany liquid funds.\nBecause of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the Company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities\u2019 statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the Company\u2019s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, for consolidation purposes. As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of our Statements of Operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years.\nRevenues and operating expenses are primarily denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our continuing operations are located, the U.S., and UK. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the two principal currencies for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTo date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk and have limited activity with forward foreign currency contracts or other similar derivative instruments.\nInvestment Risk\nThe Company has an Investment Policy that, inter alia, provides an internal control structure that takes into consideration safety (credit risk and interest rate risk), liquidity and yield. Our Investment officers, CEO and CFO, oversee the investment portfolio and compile a quarterly analysis of the investment portfolio when applicable for internal use. In addition, the Company implemented a new Investment Committee in 2019 to administer and operate the portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the Investment Committee is comprised of C. Stephen Cochennet, Corey A. Lambrecht, Chairman, and Daniel Ford, CFO. See Item 10 of this Form 10-K for more information on the Company\u2019s Investment Committee.\nCash and cash equivalents are diversified and maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.\nThe Company has trade receivable and revenue concentrations with large customers, which include a large concentration of trade receivables and revenues in the United Kingdom.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A of this Form 10-K provides a summary of the Company\u2019s exposure to market risk.

On September 7, 2017, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the New York State Supreme Court, Commercial Division, against the Company and WSFS. The amended complaint continued to assert claims for breach of the terms of the Term Loan Facility, and for fraudulent conveyance and added an additional claim for fraudulent inducement against the Company.\nIn response to the amended complaint, WSFS and the Company withdrew their prior motions to dismiss and, on October 20, 2017, filed renewed motions seeking dismissal in whole or part. Among other things, we sought dismissal of the amended complaint for failure to state a claim, lack of standing, and because its fraud claims are duplicative of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the documents governing the Term Loan Facility. Plaintiffs filed an omnibus brief on December 1, 2017 opposing the motions to dismiss.

However, more than 50% of Adtalem\u2019s costs are in the form of wages and benefits. Changes in employment market conditions or escalations in employee benefit costs could cause Adtalem to experience cost increases at levels beyond what it has historically experienced.\nThe financial position and results of operations of AUC, RUSM and RUSVM Caribbean operations are measured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Substantially all of these financial transactions are denominated in the U.S. dollar.\nThe financial position and results of operations of Adtalem Brazil operations are measured using the Brazilian Real as the functional currency. Adtalem Brazil has not entered into any material long-term contracts to purchase or sell goods and services, other than the lease agreements on teaching facilities and contingencies relating to prior acquisitions. Currently, Adtalem does not have any foreign exchange contracts or derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate changes in the value of the Brazilian Real. Brazilian-based assets constitute 25.8% of Adtalem\u2019s overall assets, and Brazilian-based liabilities constitute 6.2% of Adtalem\u2019s overall liabilities. The value of the Brazilian Real has been volatile in relation to the U.S. dollar over the past several years. During fiscal year 2018, the value remained fairly steady compared to fiscal year 2017, but declined in value during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, finishing approximately 15% lower at June 30, 2018 compared to June 30, 2017. During fiscal year 2019, the value averaged approximately 14% lower compared to fiscal year 2018. Based upon the current value of the net assets in Adtalem Brazil\u2019s operations, a change of $0.01 in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian Real results in a translation adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss of approximately $17.2 million. For fiscal year 2019, the lower value of the Brazilian Real also resulted in lower U.S. translated revenue and operating income compared to the prior year.\nThe interest rate on Adtalem\u2019s Credit Facility is based upon LIBOR or a LIBOR-equivalent rate for Eurocurrency rate loans or a base rate for periods typically ranging from one to three months. As of June 30, 2019, Adtalem had $407.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Term B Loan and Revolver with a weighted average interest rate of 5.20%. Based upon borrowings of $407.0 million, a 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates would result in $4.1 million of additional annual interest expense.\nAdtalem\u2019s customers are principally individual students enrolled in its various educational programs. Accordingly, concentration of accounts receivable credit risk is small relative to total revenue and accounts receivable. However, the Adtalem Brazil FIES accounts receivable balance has remained elevated for the past several years due to changes in government funding of the program. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the FIES accounts receivable balance was $26.2 million and $35.9 million, respectively.\nAdtalem\u2019s cash is held in accounts at various large, financially secure depository institutions.

You should read Note 10 to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on financial instruments.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nThe functional currency for most of our international operations is the applicable local currency. Results of operations for foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and the resulting translation adjustments are included in stockholders' equity. However, foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in income for the period. We hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts.\nForward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency transactions are marked to spot with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings, offsetting losses and gains on the transactions hedged. We enter into foreign exchange contracts only as a hedge against existing economic exposures and not for speculative or trading purposes. The counterparties to our foreign exchange contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks. We believe that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is immaterial.\nAt December 31, 2000, we had open forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for Euros at an exchange value of $29.1 million. If a 10% devaluation in the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar were to occur subsequent to December 31, 2000, the exchange value of the open forward contracts would be $26.2 million.\nINTEREST RATES\nWe are and will be subject to interest rate risk on our long-term fixed interest rate debt and, to a lesser extent, variable interest rate borrowings. We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our credit facility and certain variable rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2000, we had borrowed $32.1 million under our credit facility. Additionally, at December 31, 2000, there were outstanding borrowings of $0.5 million under a miscellaneous credit facility, and there was $18.6 million of variable interest rate debt outstanding. Based upon these balances, an immediate change of one percent in the interest rate would not cause a material change in interest expense on an annual basis. Excluding the 9 5/8% Senior Notes due 2007, most of our borrowings are at variable rates and therefore the fair value of these borrowings approximates book value. The fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2000 was $232.1 million as compared to a carrying value of $224.4 million.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The company hedges its exposure to foreign exchange rate changes with forward contracts and has open forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for Euros at an exchange value of $29.1 million.

{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings. In addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to investigations by governmental and regulatory authorities, which exposes us to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory or other proceedings, including significant fines or penalties. The outcome of litigation, regulatory or other proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims, actions or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us. In addition, intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which, if imposed against us, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn February 16, 2018, we received FDA approval for our amantadine extended release tablet product under the trade name Osmolex ER. On that same date we filed in the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment of Noninfringement of certain patents owned by Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Osmotica Pharmaceutical US LLC and Vertical Pharmaceuticals, LLC vs. Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Adamas Pharma, LLC). Adamas was served with the complaint on February 21, 2018. Adamas filed an answer on April 13, 2018 denying the allegations in the complaint and reserving the ability to raise counterclaims as the litigation progresses. On September 20, 2018, Adamas filed an amended answer to our Complaint for Declaratory Judgment of Noninfringement, with counterclaims alleging infringement of certain patents included in our complaint and requesting that the court grant Adamas damages, injunctive relief and attorneys\u2019 fees. The action is ongoing, but was stayed on May 23, 2019 at the parties\u2019 joint request.\nOn April 30, 2019, Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc was served with a complaint in an action entitled Leo Shumacher, et al., v. Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc, et al., Superior Court of New Jersey, Somerset County No. SOM-L-000540-19. On May 10, 2019, a Complaint entitled Jeffrey Tello, et al., v. Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc, et al., Superior Court of New Jersey, Somerset County No. SOM-L-000617-19 was filed in the same court as the Shumacher action. The complaints name us, certain of our directors and officers and the underwriters of our initial public offering as defendants in putative class actions alleging violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 related to the disclosures contained in the registration statement and prospectus used for our initial public offering of ordinary shares. On July 22, 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint consolidating the two actions, reiterating the previously pled allegations and adding an additional individual defendant. We dispute the allegations in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend against the action. However, this litigation matter is still in an early stage and there is no assurance that we will be successful in our defense or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of the action, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn general, we intend to continue to vigorously prosecute and defend these proceedings, as appropriate; however, from time to time, we may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions that we believe are in our best interests. Resolution of any or all claims, investigations and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows in any given accounting period or on our overall financial condition.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE\n\nOsmotica Pharmaceuticals plc is subject to various legal proceedings, including a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment of Noninfringement of certain patents owned by Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and two putative class actions alleging violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 related to the disclosures contained in the registration statement and prospectus used for its initial public offering of ordinary shares.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We invest our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in securities of the U.S. governments and its agencies and in investment-grade, highly liquid investments consisting of commercial paper, bank certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were classified as available-for-sale. We place our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities with high-quality financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution, and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity.\nBased on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments, and cash flows are immaterial, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis. While we believe our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that, in the future, our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given the potential instability of financial institutions, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits. We do not utilize interest rate hedging agreements or other interest rate derivative instruments.\nA hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results or cash flows. All of our significant interest-bearing liabilities bear interest at fixed rates and therefore are not subject to fluctuations in market interest rates; however, because these interest rates are fixed, we may be paying a higher interest rate, relative to market, in the future if circumstances change.\nForeign Currency Risk\nSubstantially all of our revenues are recognized in U.S. dollars, although a growing percentage is denominated in foreign currency as we continue to expand into markets outside of the U.S. Certain expenses related to our international activities are payable in foreign currencies. As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets will affect our financial results.\nIn 2017 and 2018, our international subsidiaries functional currency was the local currency. For 2019 our international subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, resulting in no net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In September 2017, Genomic Health (now a wholly owned subsidiary) started entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of adverse movements in foreign exchange rates related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities and hedge our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. As of December 31, 2019, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $17.9 million. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has been immaterial in the past, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations related to our international activities will not be material in the future.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThis text discusses the market risk associated with the company's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities. It states that the company does not use interest rate hedging agreements or other interest rate derivative instruments, and that a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on future operating results or cash flows. The company also has exposure to foreign currency risk, but the impact of currency fluctuations on its financial results has been immaterial in the past.

{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn April 2013, the Company commenced an action against AVX Corporation and AVX Filters Corporation (collectively \u201cAVX\u201d) alleging that AVX had infringed the Company\u2019s patents by manufacturing and selling filtered feedthrough assemblies used in implantable pacemakers and cardioverter defibrillators that incorporate the Company\u2019s patented technology. Two juries in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware have returned verdicts finding that AVX infringed three of the Company\u2019s patents and awarded the Company $37.5 million in damages. In March 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware vacated the original damage award and ordered a retrial on damages. In the January 2019 retrial on damages, the jury awarded the Company $22.2 million in damages. On July 31, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware entered an order denying AVX\u2019s post-trial motion to overturn the jury verdict in favor of the Company. On August 23, 2019, AVX filed its notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On September 5, 2019, the Company filed its notice of cross-appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nIn January 2015, LRM was notified by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (\u201cNJDEP\u201d) of NJDEP\u2019s intent to revoke a no further action determination made by NJDEP in favor of LRM in 2002 pertaining to a property on which a subsidiary of LRM operated a manufacturing facility in South Plainfield, New Jersey beginning in 1971. LRM sold the property in 2004 and vacated the facility in 2007. In response to NJDEP\u2019s notice, LRM further investigated the matter and submitted a technical report to NJDEP in August of 2015 that concluded that NJDEP\u2019s notice of intent to revoke was unwarranted. After reviewing the technical report, NJDEP issued a draft response in May 2016 stating that NJDEP would not revoke the no further action determination at that time but would require some additional site investigation to support the Company\u2019s conclusion. The Company is cooperating with NJDEP and has begun the requested additional investigation. In late 2019, NJDEP informed LRM that NJDEP was considering taking over the investigation of the property in light of LRM\u2019s difficulty in securing access to the property from the current owner. Separately, in April 2019, NJDEP indicated it believes the property to be a contributing source to local groundwater contamination. The Company disagrees with NJDEP\u2019s assertion; however, the Company is cooperating with NJDEP on this matter. The Company does not expect that this environmental matter will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe are party to various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business. A description of pending legal actions against the Company is set forth in Note 13 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report. Other than as discussed in Note 13, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal actions will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nDow's business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. To manage such risks effectively, the Company enters into hedging transactions, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, which enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk. A secondary objective is to add value by creating additional exposure within established limits and policies. The potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the Company's results.\nThe global nature of Dow's business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets. As a result of investments, production facilities and other operations on a global basis, the Company has assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary objective of the Company's foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the U.S. dollar value of net assets and cash flows, keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts and over-the-counter option contracts. Main exposures are related to assets and liabilities denominated in the currencies of Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada; bonds denominated in foreign currencies-mainly the Euro and Japanese yen; and economic exposure derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows. The majority of the foreign exchange exposure is related to European currencies and the Japanese yen.\nThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. Dow uses interest rate swaps, \"swaptions,\" and exchange traded instruments to accomplish this objective. The Company's primary exposure is to the U.S. dollar yield curve.\nInherent in Dow's business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. Some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments. Cracker feedstocks and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures. Over-the-counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible. The risk of these hedging instruments was not material in 1999.\nDow has a portfolio of equity securities derived from its acquisition and divestiture activity. This exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the Company's market risk policies and procedures.\nDow uses value at risk (VAR), stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes. VAR estimates the potential gain or loss in fair market values, given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time, using specified confidence levels. On an ongoing basis, the Company estimates the maximum gain or loss that could arise in one day, given a two-standard-deviation move in the respective price levels. These amounts are relatively insignificant in comparison to the size of the equity and earnings of the Company. The VAR methodology used by Dow is based primarily on the variance/covariance statistical model.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its unsecured bank credit facilities and long-term debt maturities. This debt is used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company\u2019s real estate investment portfolio and operations. The Company\u2019s objective for interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. The Company has two variable rate unsecured bank credit facilities as discussed under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As market conditions permit, EastGroup issues equity and/or employs fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace the short-term bank borrowings. The Company's interest rate swaps are discussed in Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below presents the principal payments due and weighted average interest rates, which include the impact of interest rate swaps, for both the fixed rate and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020.\n(1)The variable rate unsecured bank credit facilities mature in July 2022 and as of December 31, 2020, have balances of $125,000,000 on the $350 million unsecured bank credit facility and $0 on the $45 million unsecured bank credit facility.\n(2)The fair value of the Company\u2019s variable rate debt is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at current market rates, excluding the effects of debt issuance costs.\n(3)Represents the weighted average interest rate for the Company's variable rate unsecured bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2020.\n(4)The fair value of the Company\u2019s fixed rate debt, including variable rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, as advised by the Company\u2019s bankers, excluding the effects of debt issuance costs.\nAs the table above incorporates only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2020, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. If the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate unsecured bank credit facilities, as shown above, changes by 10%, or approximately 12 basis points, interest expense and cash flows would increase or decrease by approximately $144,000 annually.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risks include risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market-sensitive instruments. We expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk, including the risk of changes in the underlying rates on our variable rate debt. Our current indebtedness consists of our KeyBank Loans, AIG, AIG II, BOA, BOA/KeyBank loans and property secured mortgages. These instruments were not entered into for trading purposes.\nOur interest rate risk management objectives will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. We may also utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swap agreements, caps, floors, and other interest rate exchange contracts. We will not enter into these financial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts.\nOn August 31, 2018, we executed four interest rate swap agreements to hedge future variable cash flows associated with LIBOR. The forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $425.0 million become effective on July 1, 2020 and have a term of five years.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our debt consisted of approximately $1.4 billion in fixed rate debt and approximately $536.5 million in variable rate debt (including the interest rate swaps and excluding unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts, net, of approximately $10.0 million). As of December 31, 2018, our debt consisted of approximately $1.1 billion in fixed rate debt and approximately $290.0 million in variable rate debt (including the interest rate swaps and excluding unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts, net, of approximately $8.6 million). Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate debt. A change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts its fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on variable rate debt could impact the interest incurred and cash flows and its fair value.\nOur future earnings and fair values relating to variable rate financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, such as LIBOR Rate. However, our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate changes. The effect of an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, assuming a LIBOR Rate floor of 0%, on our variable-rate debt, including our KeyBank Loans, AIG, AIG II, BOA, BOA/KeyBank loans and our mortgage loans, after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements would decrease our future earnings and cash flows by approximately $8.8 million annually.\nInterest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and equity price risk.

Such values are affected by changes in financial markets (including declines in the capital markets, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates or the yield curve, and other market factors) and, accordingly, declines in the financial markets may negatively impact our Consolidated revenue and equity method revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we estimate a proportional 1% change in the value of our assets under management would have resulted in an annualized change in asset based fees in Consolidated revenue of $19.4 million for our consolidated Affiliates and in asset based fees in equity method revenue of $15.8 million for our Affiliates accounted for under the equity method.\nThis proportional increase or decrease excludes assets under management on which asset based fees are charged on committed capital.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have fixed rates of interest on our senior notes, junior subordinated notes and junior convertible securities. While a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on our fixed rate securities, such a change may affect the fair value of these securities. We estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would have resulted in a net change in the fair value of our fixed rate securities of $129.1 million as of December 31, 2019. This estimate increased relative to the prior year primarily due to the issuance of our junior subordinated notes in 2019. We pay a variable rate of interest on our credit facilities at specified rates, based either on an applicable LIBOR or prime rate, plus a marginal rate determined based on our credit rating. As of December 31, 2019, the interest rate for our outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities was LIBOR plus 0.875%. We estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would have changed our annual interest expense on the outstanding balances under our credit facilities by $4.5 million, as of December 31, 2019.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nThe functional currency of most of our Affiliates is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our Affiliates have the pound sterling or the Canadian dollar as their functional currency, and are, therefore, impacted by movements in pound sterling and Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the valuations of our foreign Affiliates with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency change based on fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These changes are recorded as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity.\nTo illustrate the effect of possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we estimate a 1% change in the pound sterling and Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rates would have resulted in changes to stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, based on the December 31, 2019 carrying value of Affiliates whose functional currency is the pound sterling or the Canadian dollar, and of our and our Affiliates\u2019 pound sterling-denominated derivative financial instruments.

Our international operations currently include business activity out of offices in the Australia, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against a foreign currency, the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to U.S. dollars decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens, the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to U.S. dollars increases.

In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk.\nWe have obtained variable rate debt financing to fund certain property acquisitions, and we are exposed to changes in the one-month LIBOR. Our objectives in managing interest rate risk seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows, and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we will borrow primarily at interest rates with the lowest margins available and, in some cases, with the ability to convert variable interest rates to fixed rates.\nWe have entered, and may continue to enter, into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a given variable rate financial instrument. To the extent we do, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a\nderivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, it does not possess credit risk. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. We manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. We may also enter into rate-lock arrangements to lock interest rates on future borrowings.\nIn addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our future investments will be subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt, if necessary.\nThe following table summarizes our principal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019 (amounts in thousands):\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate on our total debt outstanding was 4.2%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $658.0 million of the $1,365.3 million total principal debt outstanding was subject to variable interest rates with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9% per annum.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk. Many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control, contribute to interest rate risk.\nAs of December 31, 2019, after consideration of $400 million of interest rates swaps in effect, we had outstanding $617.0 million of consolidated indebtedness that bore interest at variable rates.\nWe monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 1% change in year-end interest rates. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase the interest expense on the $617.0 million of variable indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2019 by approximately $6.2 million annually. Conversely, a decrease in the LIBOR rate to 0.76% would decrease the interest expense on this $617.0 million of variable indebtedness outstanding by approximately $6.2 million annually based on the one month LIBOR rate of approximately 1.763% as of December 31, 2019.\nOn April 5, 2017, the Company entered into forward interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million. The forward swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on $400 million of term loan borrowings, $200 million of swaps allocated to Term Loan A and $200 million allocated to Term Loan B, from January 2, 2018 through December 17, 2021 and April 27, 2022, respectively, at approximately 3.2% assuming the current LIBOR spread of 1.2%.\nOn December 20, 2018, we entered into additional forward interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million. The forward swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on $400 million of term loan borrowings, $200 million of swaps allocated to Term Loan A and $200 million allocated to Term Loan B, from December 17, 2021 through December 17, 2023 and April 27, 2022 through April 27, 2024, respectively. The weighted average effective fixed interest rate on the $400 million notional amount of term loan financing following the commencement of these swap agreements will approximate 3.8%, commencing on December 17, 2021 and April 27, 2022, assuming the current LIBOR spread of 1.2%. On December 20, 2018, the Company entered into additional forward interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $200 million. The forward swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on $100 million of additional term loan borrowings from January 2, 2020 through December 17, 2023 as well as $100 million of additional term loan borrowings from January 2, 2020 through April 27, 2024.

The face amount of our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2019 was $1.1 billion of which $250 million was variable rate. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt fluctuate by 100 basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, depending on rate movement, future earnings and cash flows, by approximately $2.5 million annually.\nOn January 7, 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix LIBOR at 2.41% through maturity for our $50 million unsecured term loan. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on July 25, 2019 to fix LIBOR at 1.70% through maturity for $175 million of our $350 million unsecured term loan.

As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR. The Company is not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be published or precisely how SOFR will be calculated and published. Any changes adopted by the FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR.

In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form.\nThe Company has contracts that are indexed to LIBOR and is monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest amounts on our variable rate debt and the swap rate for our interest rate swaps as discussed in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Such an event would not affect the Company\u2019s ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or swaps, but the alternative reference rate could be higher and more volatile than LIBOR.\nCertain risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to an alternative reference rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. The value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require substantial negotiation with each respective counterparty.\nIf a contract is not transitioned to an alternative reference rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact is likely to vary by contract. If LIBOR is discontinued or if the method of calculating LIBOR changes from its current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected.\nWhile we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A of the financial statement discloses the Company's exposure to market risk, primarily interest rate risk.

Primary exposures include the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). From time to time, we use interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to mitigate our exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances, thereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally, under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange floating-rate for fixed-rate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Some of the Company\u2019s contracts with respect to its borrowings and interest rate swap contracts already contain comparable alternative reference rates that would automatically take effect upon the phasing out of LIBOR. For certain other contracts that do not already contain sufficient alternative reference rate provisions, the Company anticipates negotiating comparable replacement reference rates with its counterparties.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.3 billion of debt outstanding under our debt facilities, which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index.

Exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease, to the extent that the Company\u2019s borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility or Receivables Financing Facilities increase or decrease, respectively.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe provide products and services in approximately 180 countries throughout the world and, therefore, at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates. On occasion, we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable. We also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies. We manage these risks using derivative financial instruments. See Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of hedging activities.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Czech Koruna, Brazilian Real and Chinese Yuan. A one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $1 million. This amount is inclusive of the impact of associated derivative contracts. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of certain entities with exposures denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are typically one month in maturity and are not designated as hedges.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Zebra is exposed to market risk, primarily in the form of interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed only to U.S. Dollar interest rate changes and, accordingly, we manage exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin. We do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as trading. Finally, we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk or other market risks.\nInterest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution. The sensitivity to rate changes is known as \u201cinterest rate risk.\u201d The repricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income. As part of our asset/liability management program, the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management.\nAs indicated by the table below, we are slightly asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates in the one-year and two-year time horizons. Being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment.\nWe use simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates. The simulation of rising, declining and flat interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings. The analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve-month period is subjected to an instantaneous 100 basis point increase or 100 basis point decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis. Our most recent model projects net interest income would increase slightly if rates rise 100 basis points over the next year. A scenario involving more than a 100 basis point decrease is irrelevant at this time due to the level of current market rates.\nThe following table presents the earnings simulation model\u2019s projected impact of a change in interest rates on the projected baseline net interest income for the 12- and 24-month periods commencing January 1, 2020. This change in interest rates assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve and does not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve.\nIn the event of a shift in interest rates, we may take certain actions intended to mitigate the negative impact to net interest income or to maximize the positive impact to net interest income. These actions may include, but are not limited to, restructuring of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, seeking alternative funding sources or investment opportunities and modifying the pricing or terms of loans, leases and deposits.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes presented elsewhere in this report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. This requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, the vast majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThis text provides a summary of the market risk faced by a financial institution.

The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. government agency bonds or money market funds invested exclusively in government agency bonds and A or higher rated corporate bonds.\nDue to changes in interest rates, our future investment income may fall short of expectations. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in market interest rates would not result in a material change in interest income earned through maturity on investments held at December 31, 2019. We do not hold or issue derivatives, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to currency fluctuations due to our foreign operations and because we sell our products internationally. We manage the sensitivity of our international sales by denominating the majority of transactions in U.S. dollars. During 2019, approximately 4% of our billings were in the Chinese yuan. We manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies, thereby mitigating the risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. However, our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in U.S. dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the U.S. dollar. As exchange rates vary, these results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability.\nWe had $2.1 million of cash in bank accounts in China at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had no intention of repatriating cash in our foreign bank accounts in China. If we decide to repatriate the cash in these foreign bank accounts, we may experience difficulty in repatriating the cash in a timely manner. We may also be exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and taxes if we repatriate these funds.\nWe completed the closure of our Israel subsidiary during the fourth quarter 2018 and repatriated the remaining cash of $0.2 million during the second quarter of 2019.\nCredit Risk\nThe financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. For trade receivables, credit risk is the potential for a loss due to a customer not meeting its payment obligations. Our customers are concentrated in the wireless communications industry. Estimates are used in determining an allowance for amounts which we may not be able to collect, based on current trends, the length of time receivables are past due and historical collection experience. Provisions for and recovery of bad debts are recorded as sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. We perform ongoing evaluations of customers' credit limits and financial condition.

Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to our outstanding derivatives.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 1% of our outstanding consolidated debt, excluding the amount of variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, had variable interest rates and therefore was subject to market fluctuations. A change in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $114,000 in interest expense on an annual basis.\nThe interest rate spreads associated with our unsecured lines of credit and our unsecured term loan are based on the higher of our two investment grade credit ratings. Changes to our credit ratings could cause our interest rate spread to adjust accordingly. In February 2020, due to a change in our credit rating, our interest rate spread over LIBOR on our $600.0 million unsecured line of credit facility increased from 0.875% to 1.0% and our annual facility fee increased from 0.15% to 0.20%. As of December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding balances under our unsecured lines of credit. In addition, our interest rate spread over LIBOR on our $350.0 million unsecured term loan increased from 0.90% to 1.0%. If additional decreases to our credit ratings occurs, interest expense could increase depending upon the level of downgrade.\nThe information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value. As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.\nThe estimated fair value and recorded value of our debt consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, secured mortgages and unsecured lines of credit was as follows (in thousands):\nA 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 would result in a decrease in fair value of total consolidated debt of approximately $62.9 million and $65.6 million, respectively.

Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could realize on the disposition of the financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency risk on investments in outlet centers that are located in Canada. Our currency exposure is concentrated in the Canadian Dollar. To mitigate the risk related to changes in foreign currency, cash flows received from our Canadian joint ventures are either reinvested to fund ongoing Canadian development activities, if applicable, or converted to U.S. dollars and utilized to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 28, 2019, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.\nAs of December 28, 2019, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.\nWe will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.\nDefault Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 28, 2019, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.\nThe following table presents certain information for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 28, 2019:\nForeign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nWe maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn applying our strategy, from time to time we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses to the extent eligible under the accounting rules and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. To the extent such hedges are effective, the gain or loss on these contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and\nreclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nWe also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe may be exposed to interest rate risk should we decide to invest in marketable securities. When we held marketable securities, we classified them as available-for-sale and were carried at fair value. Our investments historically consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and government municipal bonds. Our investment policy specifies the types of eligible investments and minimum credit quality of our investments, as well as diversification and concentration limits which mitigate our risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate risk because the majority of our investments mature in less than one year.\nWe are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2020, we had $48.1 million outstanding under our Term Loan and $15.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Loan. Prior to May 4, 2020, borrowings under the Credit Facility bore interest rates based on an underlying variable benchmark plus applicable margin based on our total leverage (\"ABR\"); this interest rate was reset quarterly. Effective May 4, 2020, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin spread from 3.25% to 1.25%. The amount of the applicable margin spread is a function of our leverage ratio and is reset monthly. Based on the balance sheet position for both the Term Loan and Revolving Loan at September 30, 2020, the annualized effect of a 25 basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease our interest expense by $0.3 million. For additional information, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. For our Credit Facility, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instruments, but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nWe are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk associated with certain sales being denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen or Canadian Dollars and in certain cases, transactions in U.S. Dollars in our foreign entities. We are also exposed to foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidation. We manage our net asset or net liability position for non-functional currency accounts, primarily the U.S. dollar accounts in our foreign locations to reduce our foreign currency risk. In addition, as foreign currency rates fluctuate, we may from time to time, adjust the prices of our products, services and subscriptions. We have not implemented a formal hedging strategy.\nThe table below compares the average monthly exchange rates of the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and Canadian Dollar:\nA 10.0% change from the 2020 average exchange rate for the Euro, British Pound, Yen and Canadian Dollar to the U.S. Dollar would have resulted in a 0.1% increase or decrease in fiscal 2020 annual revenue and a 0.9% increase or decrease in stockholders' equity at September 30, 2020. The above analysis does not take into consideration any pricing adjustments we may make in response to changes in the exchange rates.\nCREDIT RISK\nWe have some exposure to credit risk related to our accounts receivable portfolio. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through regular monitoring of customer financial status, credit limits and collaboration with sales management on customer contacts to facilitate payment.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks associated with the company's investments, borrowings, and accounts receivable.

The new revolving credit facility allows certain foreign subsidiaries to borrow up to $75 million in British Pounds Sterling, German Deutsche Marks and Euros. The Company has not made borrowings in any of these currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\n................Interest rate risk exposure is primarily the result of floating rate borrowings. A portion of the interest rate risks have been hedged by entering into a swap and collar agreements. Since the counterparties to the agreements are also lenders under the senior secured credit facility, obligations under these agreements are subject to the security interest under the terms of the senior secured credit facility.

{"section": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nYou are cautioned that statements contained in this section are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the disclosure under the heading \u201cCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A Risk Factors set forth above.\nWe are exposed to market risks associated with changes in interest rates as they relate to our mortgage loans receivable and debt. Interest rate risk is sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe do not utilize interest rate swaps, forward or option contracts, or foreign currencies or commodities, or other types of derivative financial instruments nor do we engage in \u201coff-balance sheet\u201d transactions. The purpose of the following disclosure is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2020.\nOur future earnings, cash flows and estimated fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, such as LIBOR or term rates of U.S. Treasury Notes. Changes in interest rates generally impact the fair value, but not future earnings or cash flows, of mortgage loans receivable and fixed rate debt. Our mortgage loans receivable and debt, such as our senior unsecured notes, are primarily fixed-rate instruments. For variable rate debt, such as our revolving line of credit, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value, but do affect future earnings and cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2020, the fair value of our mortgage loans receivable using a 10.0% discount rate was approximately $299.8 million. A 1% increase in such rate would decrease the estimated fair value of our mortgage loans by approximately $25.4 million while a 1% decrease in such rate would increase their estimated fair value by approximately $29.4 million. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of our senior unsecured notes using a 3.25% discount rate for those maturing before year 2026 and 3.50% discount rate for those maturing at or beyond year 2026 was approximately $581.2 million. A 1% increase in such rate would decrease the estimated fair value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately $27.9 million while a 1% decrease in such rate would increase their estimated fair value by approximately $29.9 million. These discount rates were measured based upon management\u2019s estimates of rates currently prevailing for comparable loans available to us and instruments of comparable maturities.\nThe estimated impact of changes in interest rates discussed above are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs, lending rates and current U.S. Treasury rates from which our financial instruments may be priced. We do not believe that future market rate risks related to our financial instruments will be material to our financial position or results of operations. These analyses do not consider the effects of industry specific events, changes in the real estate markets, or other overall economic activities that could increase or decrease the fair value of our financial instruments. If such events or changes were to occur, we would consider taking actions to mitigate and/or reduce any negative exposure to such changes. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis section of the text discusses the market risks associated with changes in interest rates and their impact on the fair value of the company's mortgage loans receivable and debt.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nUnder smaller reporting company rules we are not required to disclose information required under Item 7A. However, in order to provide information to our investors, we have elected to provide information related to market risk.\nThe Company's primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk. Investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates, overall market conditions, underwriting results, regulatory requirements and tax position. Investment decisions are made by management and reviewed by the Board of Directors. Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities. The three potential risks related to the Company's fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk, prepayment risk and default risk. The primary risk related to the Company's equity portfolio is equity price risk.\nSince the Company's assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature, the Company's financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities, changes in spreads over U.S. Treasuries on new investment opportunities and changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks.\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities. The Company holds common stock with a fair value of $4,750,000. Our portfolio has historically been highly correlated to the S&P 500 with regard to market risk. Based on an evaluation of the historical risk measure of our portfolio relative to the S&P 500, if the market value of the S&P 500 Index decreased 10% from its December 31, 2020 value, the fair value of the Company's common stock investments would decrease by approximately $475,000.\nCertain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values. Note 5 in the Consolidated Financial Statements present additional disclosures concerning fair values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and are incorporated by reference herein.\nThe Company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by entities considered to be financially stable, the majority of the assets are issued by U.S. government sponsored entities or corporate entities with debt considered to be \"investment grade\".\nThe Company's investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value. This approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed, primarily dividend paying companies, which have a low debt to capital ratio, above average return on capital for a sustained period of time, and low volatility rating (beta) relative to the market. The dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities, and it has been the Company's experience that by following this investment strategy, long-term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds, while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market.\nAs for shifts in investment allocations, the Company has used improved cash flows from insurance operations to increase allocations to fixed maturity securities in order to limit volatility of statutory capital of the insurance subsidiaries.\nIt should be noted that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has added a new element of uncertainty surrounding market risk in our investment portfolio. The extent of short and long term economic damage from the global shutdown due to this pandemic remains unknown due to uncertainty surrounding both the duration of the pandemic and speed at which the US and global economies can fully resume some level of normalcy. The increased risk associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be difficult to quantify due to these uncertainties.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A of the Company's disclosure provides a summary of the Company's market risk.

{"section": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings - ------ -----------------\nVarious lawsuits, claims and proceedings are pending against the Company.\nThe Company is one of a number of defendants in numerous proceedings that allege that the plaintiffs contracted cancer and/or suffered other injuries from exposure to \"toxic\" substances purportedly supplied by the Company and other defendants. The Company is also subject to a number of environmental contingencies (see Note 18, \"Environmental Costs,\" for further detail) and is a defendant in a number of lawsuits covering a wide range of other matters. In some of these matters, the remedies sought or damages claimed are substantial. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits or the resolution of the environmental contingencies, Management believes, after consultation with counsel, that resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on financial condition. These matters, if resolved in a manner different from Management's current expectations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results or cash flows.\nIn 1998, Management learned that Engelhard and several other companies operating in Japan had been victims of a fraudulent scheme involving base-metal inventory held in third-party warehouses in Japan. The inventory loss was approximately $40 million in 1997 and $20 million in 1998. The Company is vigorously pursuing various recovery actions. These actions include negotiations with the various third parties involved and, in several instances, the commencement of litigation. In the first quarter of 1998, Engelhard recorded a receivable from the insurance carriers and third parties for approximately $20 million. This amount represents Management's and counsel's best estimate of the minimum probable recovery from the various insurance policies and other parties involved in the fraudulent scheme.\nThe Company is involved in a value-added tax dispute in Peru. Management believes the Company was targeted by corrupt officials within the former Peruvian Government. On December 2, 1999, Engelhard Peru, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary, was denied refund claims of approximately $28 million. The Peruvian tax authority also determined that Engelhard Peru, S.A. is liable for approximately $63 million in refunds previously paid, fines and interest as of December 31, 1999. Interest and fines continue to accrue at rates established by Peruvian law. Engelhard Peru, S.A. is contesting these determinations vigorously, and Management believes, based on consultation with counsel, that Engelhard Peru, S.A. is entitled to all refunds claimed and is not liable for these additional taxes, fines or interest. In late October 2000, a criminal proceeding alleging tax fraud and forgery related to this value-added tax dispute was initiated against two Lima-based officials of Engelhard Peru, S.A. Although Engelhard Peru, S.A. is not a defendant, it may be civilly liable for criminal conduct of its representatives and Engelhard Peru is assisting in the vigorous defense of this proceeding. Management believes the maximum economic exposure is limited to the aggregate value of all assets of Engelhard Peru, S.A., including unpaid refunds, which is approximately $30 million.\nItem 4.", "summary": "The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including lawsuits alleging that plaintiffs contracted cancer and/or suffered other injuries from exposure to \"toxic\" substances, environmental contingencies, and a range of other matters.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nOur primary market risk exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest cost of draws on our revolving variable rate credit facility and the effect of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.\nWe use interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk on variable rate mortgages. These swaps are used for hedging purposes-not for speculation. We do not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes. At December 31, 2020, our aggregate liability in the event of the early termination of our swaps was $5.3 million.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had 23 interest rate swap agreements outstanding. The fair market value of the interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads, which change over time. As of December 31, 2020, if there had been an increase of 100 basis points in forward interest rates, the fair market value of the interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately $2.9 million and the net unrealized loss on derivative instruments would have decreased by $2.9 million. If there were a decrease of 100 basis points in forward interest rates, the fair market value of the interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately $3.1 million and the net unrealized loss on derivative instruments would have increased by $3.1 million. These changes would not have any impact on our net income or cash.\nOur variable mortgage debt, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly, the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages.\nOur variable rate credit facility is sensitive to interest rate changes. At December 31, 2020, a 100 basis point increase of the interest rate on this facility would increase our related interest costs by approximately $130,000 per year and a 100 basis point decrease of the interest rate would decrease our related interest costs by approximately $19,000 per year.\nThe fair market value of our long-term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration.\nThe following table sets forth our debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value at December 31, 2020:\n(1)Our credit facility matures on December 31, 2022 and bears interest at the 30 day LIBOR rate plus the applicable margin.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe consider market risk to be the impact of adverse changes in market prices on our results of operations. We are subject to significant market risk with respect to the price of ethanol and corn. For the year ended September 30, 2019, sales of ethanol represented 76% of our total revenues and corn costs represented 75% of total cost of goods sold. In general, ethanol prices are affected by the supply and demand for ethanol, the cost of ethanol production, the availability of other fuel oxygenates, the regulatory climate and the cost of alternative fuels such as gasoline. The price of corn is affected by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, farmer planting decisions and general economic, market and regulatory factors. At September 30, 2019, the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of corn on the CBOT were $1.37 and $3.88, respectively.\nWe are also subject to market risk on the selling prices of our distillers\u2019 grains, which represented 20% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. These prices fluctuate seasonally when the price of corn or other cattle feed alternatives fluctuate in price. The average dried distillers\u2019 grains spot price for local customers was $126 per ton at September 30, 2019.\nWe are also subject to market risk with respect to our supply of natural gas that we consume in the ethanol production process. Natural gas costs represented 5% of total cost of sales for the year ended September 30, 2019. The price of natural gas is affected by overall supply, weather conditions and general economic, market and regulatory factors. At September 30, 2019, the price of natural gas on the NYMEX was $2.33 per mmbtu.\nTo reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in the cost and selling prices of related commodities, we have entered into forward purchase/sale contracts. We entered into forward sales contracts which guaranteed prices on 16% of our ethanol gallons sold through October 2019. At September 30, 2019 we had entered into forward sale contracts representing 36% of our expected distillers\u2019 grains production output through October 2019.\nThe following represents a sensitivity analysis that estimates our annual exposure to market risk with respect to our current corn and natural gas requirements and ethanol sales. Market risk is estimated as the potential impact on operating income resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in the fair value of our current corn and natural gas requirements and ethanol sales, net of corn and natural gas forward contracts used to hedge market risk with respect to our current corn and natural gas requirements. The results of this analysis, which may differ from actual results, are as follows:\n(1)\nThe volume of ethanol at risk is based on the assumption that we will enter into contracts for 10% of our expected annual gallons capacity of 80 million gallons. The volume of distillers\u2019 grains at risk is based on the assumption that we will enter into contracts for 9% of our expected annual distillers\u2019 grains production of 231,000 tons. The volume of corn is based on the assumption that we will enter into forward contracts for none of our estimated current 27.1 million bushel annual requirement. The volume of natural gas is based on the assumption that we will continue to lock in none of our estimated gas usage.\n(2)\nCurrent spot prices include the CBOT price per gallon of ethanol, the local price per bushel of corn, the NYMEX price per mmbtu of natural gas and our listed local advertised dried distillers\u2019 grains price per ton as of September 30, 2019.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks faced by a company in terms of the price of ethanol, corn, distillers' grains, and natural gas.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including credit risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk.\nCredit Risk\nA substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs. We believe the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers (62.9% as of December 25, 2020) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. For more information about the customers that represent our accounts receivable balance, see Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies.\nWe have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From these analyses, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, prepayment or standby letter of credit.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe operate in international markets, which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and various foreign currencies. Historically, the majority of our revenue contracts and arrangements with third party suppliers are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Additionally, a portion of our expenses, primarily the cost to manufacture, cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services, sales and sales support and research and development, are denominated in foreign currencies. Revenue resulting from selling in currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income. As foreign currency exchange rates vary, operating income may differ from expectations. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive relative to competing products priced in such other currencies, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could result in our foreign suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. However, we do not expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to have a material effect on our results of operations.\nWe use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rates movement on our assets and liabilities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities. Our Credit Facility is comprised of a Term B loan and a revolving credit agreement with interest rates as described under Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, the Term B loan had a balance of $275.0 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2020 could result in approximately $27.5 million annual increase in interest expense on these existing principal balances.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A of the text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, including credit risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and interest rate risk.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction.\nOur operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 51 percent of our revenue in 2019, 53 percent of our revenue in 2018 and 51 percent of our revenues in 2017 were generated in U.S. dollars. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2019. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter to the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, statement of comprehensive income or cash flows.\nWe are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and Canadian currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. The Company had no derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nInterest Rate Exposure - Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities. As of December 31, 2019, we had $13.6 billion of long-term debt, excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs, discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. We have $1.0 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised of (i) $669 million of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months and (ii) $355 million of variable-rate tax-exempt bonds that are subject to repricing on either a daily or weekly basis. We currently estimate that a 100-basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2020 interest expense by $7 million.\nOur remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, 100-basis point\nincrease in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nWe are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as assets held in restricted trust funds and escrow accounts. These assets are generally invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. We believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis. We also invest a portion of our restricted trust and escrow account balances in available-for-sale securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities, mortgage- and asset-backed securities and equity securities, which generally mature over the next 10 years.\nCommodity Price Exposure - In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel; recyclable materials, including old corrugated cardboard, old newsprint and plastics; and electricity, which generally correlates with natural gas prices in many of the markets in which we operate. We attempt to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues may also increase or decrease.\nCurrency Rate Exposure - We have operations in Canada as well as certain support functions in India. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenue and operating expenses. However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: The Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and Canadian currency rates.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial risks such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity price risk associated with our input costs. We utilize derivative instruments to manage selected foreign exchange and interest rate exposures. See Note 13 to the financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt. The interest expense associated with our long-term debt will vary with market rates. In February 2017, we entered into two interest rate swap transactions with a combined notional value of $525 million to limit our exposure to interest rate increases related to a portion of our floating rate indebtedness. Under the terms of both swap transactions, we agreed to pay a fixed rate of interest of 1.52% and receive floating rate interest indexed to one-month LIBOR with monthly settlement terms with the swap counterparties. The swaps have a three-year term and expire on March 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, we estimate that 1% increase in the rates relating to the portion of our floating rate debt that is not hedged would increase annual interest requirements by approximately $6.0 million.\nBorrowings under our Term Loan and our Revolver may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which are expected to ultimately lead to the discontinuation of LIBOR or to cause LIBOR to cause LIBOR become unavailable as a benchmark rate. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in a significant increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness causing a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. We plan to carefully monitor the situation and may seek to renegotiate the benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate with our lenders in the future. See Item 1A. \"Risk Factors.\"\nForeign Currency Risk\nApproximately 5.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were made in countries outside of the U.S. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Based upon our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, we estimate that a 1% change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies would affect net sales by approximately $0.8 million. This may differ from actual results depending on the levels of net sales outside of the U.S.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are subject to commodity price risks with respect to price changes mainly in the electricity and natural gas markets and other raw material costs, such as cement, aggregates, steel and clay. Price fluctuations on our key inputs have a significant effect on our financial performance. The markets for most of these commodities are cyclical and are affected by factors such as global economic conditions, changes in or disruptions to industry production capacity, changes in inventory levels and other factors beyond our control.\nCredit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. We provide our products to customers based on an evaluation of the financial condition of our customers, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer's financial condition. We monitor the exposure for credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base and their dispersion among many different geographies.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had an individual customer within our Water Pipe & Products segment that accounted for more than 10% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe customer represented approximately 15% and 14% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and had total receivables at December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaling 11% and 16% of our total receivables, net, respectively.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur international operations create potential foreign exchange risk. Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges. We cannot predict changes in currency rates, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impacts of currency exchange rate changes, including the impacts on currency exchange rates related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Such changes could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the indicated fiscal years were as follows:\nWe have evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above. Based on our overall currency exposure, as of October 3, 2020, a 10.0% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have financial instruments, including cash equivalents and debt, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk. To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of money market demand accounts and certificates of deposit, and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer. We cannot predict changes in interest rates, including the impacts on interest rates related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Such changes could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of October 3, 2020, our only material interest rate risk is associated with our Credit Facility. Revolving commitments under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a eurocurrency or base rate plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin based on our then-current leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of October 3, 2020, the borrowing rate under the Credit Agreement was LIBOR plus 1.10%. In addition, the outstanding term loans will bear interest, at our option, at a eurocurrency rate (subject to a floor of 1.0%) plus a margin of 1.75% per annum or at a base rate plus (subject to a floor of 2.0%) a margin of 0.75% per annum. As of October 3, 2020 the term loans were subject to a 2.75% per annum interest rate. We are monitoring developments related to LIBOR; see also Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" for more information. Borrowings under the 2018 NPA are based on a fixed interest rate, thus mitigating much of our interest rate risk.

We do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks. The return on investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations.\nOur investments in portfolio securities consist of some fixed-rate debt securities. Since the debt securities are generally priced at a fixed rate, changes in interest rates do not directly affect interest income. In addition, changes in market interest rates are not typically a significant factor in the determination of fair value of these debt securities, since the securities are generally held to maturity. We determine their fair values based on the terms of the relevant debt security and the financial condition of the issuer.\nA major portion of our investment portfolio consists of equity investments in private companies. Modest changes in public market equity prices generally do not significantly impact the estimated fair value of these investments. However, significant changes in market equity prices can have a longer-term effect on valuations of private companies, which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains or losses realized on these investments.

We address interest rate risks primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. We do not currently hedge foreign exchange risk, as discussed further below. The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided regarding our foreign currency exchange rates and financial instruments to which we are a party at December 31, 2019, and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and/or foreign currency rates. We do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nInterest Rates\nWe have interest rate risk on our variable-rate debt obligations, primarily consisting of our Floorplan Line which had an outstanding balance of $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 2.7% and 3.7% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, excluding the impact of our interest rate swaps described below. Based on the average amount of variable-rate borrowings outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and before the impact of our interest rate swaps, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $18.3 million and $17.5 million change to our annual interest expense, respectively. After consideration of the average interest rate swaps in effect during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, a 100 basis-point change would have yielded a net annual change of $9.3 million in annual interest expense for both years.\nThe majority of our floorplan notes payable, mortgages and other debt are benchmarked to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The use of an alternative rate could result in increased interest expense, in addition to costs to amend the loan agreements and other applicable arrangements to a new reference rate. For further discussion, refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to our variable-rate floorplan borrowings is partially mitigated by manufacturers\u2019 interest assistance, which in some cases is influenced by changes in market based variable interest rates. We reflect interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle inventory cost until the associated vehicle is sold. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $49.1 million and $47.3 million of interest assistance as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales, respectively.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nThe functional currency of our U.K. subsidiaries is the GBP and of our Brazil subsidiaries is the BRL. Our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating financial statements of those subsidiaries into our reporting currency, which we do not hedge against based on our investment strategy in these foreign operations. A 10% devaluation in average exchange rates for the GBP to the USD would have resulted in a $219.4 million and $221.6 million decrease to our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices. We often utilize financial instrument contracts to hedge against such fluctuations. We utilize financial and commodity derivatives solely for the purpose of hedging exposures to market risk. We generally do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity and coal. Our current and expected future revenues are derived from wholesale energy sales without significant long-term revenue or supply contracts. Our results of operations are subject to the volatility of electricity and coal prices in competitive markets. We hedge certain aspects of our \"net open\" positions. We have used a hedging strategy, where appropriate, to hedge our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of this strategy involves the use of commodity forward contracts, swaps and options.\nIn 2000, we adopted a value at risk (VaR) approach to assess and manage risk. VaR measures the potential loss in a portfolio's value due to market volatility, over a specified time horizon, stated with a specific degree of probability. The quantification of market risk using VaR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse markets and instruments. The VaR approach was adopted because we feel that statistical models of risk measurement, such as VaR, provide an objective, independent assessment of our risk exposure. The use of VaR requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level for expected losses, the holding period for liquidation and the treatment of risks outside the VaR methodology, including liquidity risk and event risk. VaR, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur.\nThe use of VaR allows us to compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Because of the inherent limitations of VaR, including those specific to the variance/covariance approach, specifically the assumption that values or returns are normally distributed, we rely on VaR as only one component in our risk assessment process. In addition to using VaR measures, we perform stress and scenario analyses to estimate the economic impact of market changes on the value of our portfolios. These results are used to supplement the VaR methodology.\nWe perform our VaR calculation using a model based on the variance/covariance methodology with a delta gamma model for optionality. We express VaR as a dollar amount of the potential loss in the fair value of our portfolio based on a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period. Our daily VaR for commodity price sensitive instruments as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $5.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively.

We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures.\nWhen we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.

We deny these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "Summary: Uber is a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against them in the future.

Our net income is affected by fluctuations in interest rates (e.g. interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on short-term investments). The Company's policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. The following table summarizes information related to the Company's interest rate market risk at December 31 (in millions):\nAs announced in July 2017, LIBOR is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely impact our interest rates and related interest expense. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $3.4 billion in variable rate indebtedness. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Other Liquidity Matters, of this report, for more information on interest expense.\nA change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Assuming our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments remain at their average 2019 levels, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the Company's interest income of approximately $47 million during 2020.\nCommodity Price Risk (Aircraft Fuel). The price of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the Company's operations, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nOur operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. To provide adequate supplies of fuel, the Company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel, and the Company generally has some ability to cover short-term fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations. The Company's current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge fuel price volatility, although the Company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors. The Company's 2020 forecasted fuel consumption is presently approximately 4.5 billion gallons, and based on this forecast, a one-dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the Company's annual fuel expense by approximately $108 million.\nForeign Currency. The Company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the Company's results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. Some of the Company's more significant foreign currency exposures include the Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, European euro, British pound and Japanese yen. The Company's current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency sales, although the Company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors.\nThe result of a uniform 1% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2019 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $23 million for the year ending December 31, 2020. This sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2020 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of December 31, 2019.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations. Primary exposures include changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. These exposures can impact sales, cost of sales, costs of operations and the cost of financing and yields on cash and short-term investments. We may use derivative financial instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. However, our risk management policy does not allow us to hedge positions we do not hold nor do we enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our Revolving Credit Facility, which bears interest at floating rates based on LIBOR, or possibly an alternative reference rate to be used in place of LIBOR upon the occurrence of a benchmark transition event, plus an applicable borrowing margin or at a base rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus an applicable borrowing margin. Therefore, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt, but do impact future earnings and\ncash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. As we do not have any balance outstanding associated with the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019, this risk is currently minimal.\nWe believe that a concentration of credit risk related to our trade accounts receivable is limited because our customers are geographically dispersed and the end users are diversified across several industries. It is reasonably possible that changes in global economic conditions and/or local operating and economic conditions in the regions these customers operate, or other factors, could affect the future realization of these accounts receivable balances.\nOur foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, Brazilian Real, or British Pound. We are subject to cost of sales currency exposure when we produce products in foreign currencies such as the Euro, Brazilian Real, or British Pound and sell those products in U.S. Dollars. We are subject to transactional currency exposures when our subsidiaries (or the Company itself) enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $1.4 million on the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) resulting from gains and losses in foreign currency transactions.\nWe also are subject to currency exposure from translating the results of our global operations into the U.S. Dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate during the period. The U.S. Dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies was unfavorably impacted during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 by monthly foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against all of the foreign functional currencies for our international operations. As we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries, we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies, which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results. An analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity of our current year net sales and operating income to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We determined that if the U.S. Dollar decreased in value by 10% relative to all foreign currencies of our international operations it would result in an increase in net sales of $8.6 million and an increase in operating income of $0.8 million. If the U.S. Dollar increased in value by 10% relative to all foreign currencies of our international operations it would result in a decrease in net sales of $8.6 million and a decrease in operating income of $0.8 million.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nHEDGES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into and may in the future enter into arrangements to hedge our oil and natural gas production, whereby gains and losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity. The hedges that we have entered into generally provide a 'floor' or 'cap and floor' on the prices paid for our oil and natural gas production over a period of time. Hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including the following:\no our production does not meet the minimum production requirements under the agreement;\no the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations; or\no there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received.\nDue to our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, we believe that the use of such derivative instruments does not expose us to material risk, however, the use of derivative instruments for the hedging activities could affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. The use of such instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, but it may also limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements.\nOur hedging strategy is designed to provide protection from low commodity prices while providing some opportunity to enjoy the benefits of higher commodity prices. We have a series of natural gas futures contracts with Bank of Montreal and with an affiliate of Enron. This strategy is designed to provide a degree of protection of negative shifts in natural gas prices as reported on the Henry Hub Nymex Index on approximately 73% of our expected natural gas production from reserves currently classified as proved developed producing during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001. At the same time, we are able to participate completely in upward movements in the Henry Hub Nymex Index to the extent of approximately 76% of our expected natural gas production for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001.\nIn addition to our natural gas hedging agreements, at June 30, 2000, we have a contract on 5,000 barrels of oil per month involving floor and ceiling prices of $22.00 and $28.63 per barrel, respectively, from July 1 through December 31, 2000.\nAs of June 30, 2000 the fair value of our hedging contracts, measured as the estimated cost we would incur to terminate the arrangements, was $5.3 million. As of June 30, 2000 a 10% increase in oil and natural gas prices would have resulted in an unfavorable change of $2.0 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts and a 10% decrease in oil and natural gas prices would have resulted in a favorable change of $2.1 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts.\nINTEREST RATES\nAt June 30, 2000, our exposure to interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement. As of June 30, 2000, we are not using any derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Interest is payable on borrowings under the credit agreement based on a floating rate. If short-term interest rates average 10% higher during our fiscal year 2001 than they were during 2000, our interest expense would increase by approximately $213,000. This amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change of 10% to our outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement at June 30, 2000.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the use of hedging instruments to reduce exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas.

From time to time, there may be pending administrative proceedings on these matters. In addition, in the normal course of\nbusiness, we are involved in various legal proceedings. We believe that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nSee REGULATION and RATES under Item 1. BUSINESS for information on various regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.\nEnvironmental Matters\nIn 1999, we were notified by the Department of Justice of alleged noncompliance with the EPA's oil spill prevention, control and countermeasures (SPCC) plans and facility response plan (FRP) requirements at one of our power stations. If, in a legal proceeding, such instances of noncompliance are deemed to have occurred, we may be required to remedy any alleged deficiencies and pay civil penalties. Settlement of this matter is currently in negotiation and is not expected to have a material impact on our Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nWe also identified matters at certain other power stations that the EPA might view as not in compliance with the SPCC and FRP requirements. We reported these matters to the EPA and our plan for correcting them. The EPA has not assessed any penalties against us, pending its review of the disclosure information. Future resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nClean Air Act Matters\nDuring 2000, we received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA alleging that we failed to obtain New Source Review permits under the Clean Air Act prior to undertaking specified construction projects at our Mt. Storm Power Station in West Virginia. EPA alleges that each of these projects resulted in an increase in the emission of air pollutants beyond levels that require a New Source Review permit specified under the Clean Air Act. Also in 2000, the Attorney General of New York filed a suit alleging similar violations of the Clean Air Act at the Mt. Storm Power Station. We also received notices from the Attorneys General of Connecticut and New Jersey of their intentions to file suit for similar violations. Violations of the Clean Air Act may result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties and injunctive relief. Although we believe that we have obtained the permits necessary in connection with our generating facilities, we have reached an agreement in principle with the federal government and the state of New York to resolve this situation. The agreement in principle includes payment of a $5 million civil penalty, a commitment of $14 million for major environmental projects in Virginia, West Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York, and a 12-year, $1.2 billion capital investment program for environmental improvements at the Company's coal-fired generating stations in Virginia and West Virginia.

See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the interest rate swap agreements.\nBelow is a summary of our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2019:\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations. Generally, we export from the U.S. certain of the equipment and interior finish items and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries. A majority of the revenues and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country\u2019s local currency. U.S. GAAP requires that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency. If our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary, which could impact future results of operations as reported. Currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments. Based upon our equity ownership in our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019, holding everything else constant, a 10% immediate, simultaneous, unfavorable change in all of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed, would decrease the aggregate net book value of our investments in our international subsidiaries by approximately $46.0 million and would decrease the aggregate net income of our international subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2019 by $5.9 million, respectively.\nWe deemed Argentina to be highly inflationary beginning July 1, 2018. A highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over a three-year period.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\nIndustry Risk\nThe demand, pricing and terms for hydraulic fracturing services and related goods provided by us are largely dependent upon the level of drilling activity in the U.S. oil and natural gas industry, as well as the available supply of hydraulic fracturing equipment. These activity levels are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including, but not limited to: the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; the level of prices, and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the expected rates of declining current production; the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves; supply of actively marketed and staffed fracturing fleets; available rail and other transportation capacity; weather conditions; domestic and worldwide economic conditions; political instability in oil-producing countries; environmental regulations; technical advances affecting energy consumption; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the ability of E&P companies to raise equity capital and debt financing; and merger and divestiture activity among E&P companies.\nThe level of U.S. oil and natural gas drilling is volatile. Expected trends in oil and natural gas production activities may not materialize and demand for our services may not reflect the level of activity in the industry. Any prolonged and substantial reduction in oil and natural gas prices would likely affect oil and natural gas production levels and therefore affect demand for our services. A material decline in oil and natural gas prices or U.S. activity levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $110.0 million of debt outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 9.4%. Interest is calculated under the terms of our Credit Facilities based on our selection, from time to time, of one of the index rates available to us plus an applicable margin that varies based on certain factors.

We do not currently have or intend to enter into any derivative arrangements to protect against fluctuations in interest rates applicable to our outstanding indebtedness.\nCommodity Price Risk\nOur material and fuel purchases expose us to commodity price risk. Material costs primarily include inventory consumed while performing hydraulic fracturing services. Fuel costs consist of diesel fuel used by trucks and other motorized equipment used for hydraulic fracturing services. At times, we have been able to pass along price increases for material costs and fuel costs to customers and conversely have been required to pass along price decreases for material costs to our customers, depending on market conditions. Further, we have purchase commitments with certain vendors to supply proppant inventory used in our operations at a fixed purchase price, including certain commitments which include minimum purchase obligations.

{"section": "ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe conduct operations in local currencies in countries around the world, but we use the U.S. dollar as our presentation currency. As a result, we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risk. We cannot accurately predict the future effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial condition or results of operations, or quantify their effects on the macroeconomic environment. The proportion of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in a given period will differ from the annual proportion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was 42%, depending on the size and location of auctions held during the period. On an annual basis, we expect fluctuations in revenues and operating expenses to largely offset and generally act as a natural hedge against exposure to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar.\nDuring 2019, we recorded a net decrease in our foreign currency translation adjustment balance of $2.9 million, compared to a net decrease of $13.8 million in 2018 and a net increase of $24.6 million in 2017. Our foreign currency translation adjustment arises from the translation of our net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar to the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes. Based on our exposures to foreign currency transactions as at December 31, 2019, and assuming all other variables remain constant, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar would result in an increase/decrease of approximately $28.4 million in our consolidated comprehensive income, of which $26.8 million relates to our foreign currency translation adjustment and $1.6 million to our net income.\nInterest Rate Risk\nLoans under our syndicated and foreign credit facilities, bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate (or Canadian prime rate for certain Canadian dollar borrowings) or LIBOR (or such floating rate customarily used by the syndicate for currencies other than U.S. dollars). In either case, an applicable margin is added to the rate. As at December 31, 2019, we had a total of $159.3 million in loans (short-term facilities drawn and term loans) bearing floating rates of interest, as compared to $242.1 million at December 31, 2018. Based on the amount owing as at December 31, 2019, and assuming all other variables remain constant, a change in the interest rate by 100 bps would result in an increase/decrease of approximately $1.6 million in the pre-tax interest we accrue per annum.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk decreased at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, primarily due to the repayment of $76.3 million of term loans during 2019. The Notes of US $500.0 million, which represent 76% of our long-term debt, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.375% per annum. The proportion of fixed-to-floating interest rates is expected to increase as we make the required principal repayments on our term loans and execute on our debt management strategies. We continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk, and while we have not adopted a long-term hedging strategy to protect against interest rate fluctuations associated with our variable rate debt, we may consider hedging specific borrowings if we deem it appropriate in the future.\nInflation\nAlthough we cannot accurately anticipate the future effect of inflation on our financial condition or results of operations, inflation historically has not had a material impact on our operations.\nRitchie Bros.\nITEM 8:", "summary": "QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK is a disclosure of the company's exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, and inflation.

In 2019, the company recorded a net decrease in its foreign currency translation adjustment balance of $2.9 million.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. During the period covered by our financial statements, many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates, and we expect that many of our loans to portfolio companies in the future will also have floating interest rates based on LIBOR or an equivalent risk-free index rate. Interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments, the value of our Common Stock and our rate of return on invested capital. In addition, U.S. and global capital markets and credit markets have experienced a higher level of stress due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in an increase in the level of volatility across such markets and a general decline in value of the securities held by us. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decrease in LIBOR and a general reduction of certain interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks. A continued decline in interest rates, including LIBOR, could result in a reduction of our gross investment income.\nAlthough we believe that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not reflect potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and other business developments that could affect our net increase in net assets resulting from operations or net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from those shown above.\nIn addition, any investments we make that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved.\nWe may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates.

Management of the Company and Independent Bank, following consultation with legal counsel, do not expect the ultimate disposition of any, or a combination, of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company or Independent Bank. A legal proceeding that the Company believes could become material is described below.\nIndependent Bank is a party to a legal proceeding inherited by Independent Bank in connection with the Company's acquisition of BOH Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary, Bank of Houston, or BOH, that was completed on April 15, 2014. Several entities related to R. A. Stanford, or the Stanford Entities, including Stanford International Bank, Ltd., or SIBL, had deposit accounts at BOH. Certain individuals who had purchased certificates of deposit from SIBL filed a class action lawsuit against several banks, including BOH, on November 11, 2009 in the U.S. District Court Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, in a case styled Peggy Roif Rotstain, et al. on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, v. Trustmark National Bank, et al., Civil Action No. 3:09-CV-02384-N-BG. The suit alleges, among other things, that the plaintiffs were victims of fraud by SIBL and other Stanford Entities and seeks to recover damages and alleged fraudulent transfers by the defendant banks.\nOn May 1, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting permission to file a Second Amended Class Action Complaint in this case, which motion was subsequently granted. The Second Amended Class Action Complaint asserted previously unasserted claims, including aiding and abetting or participation in a fraudulent scheme based upon the large amount of deposits that the Stanford Entities held at BOH and the alleged knowledge of certain BOH officers. The plaintiffs seek recovery from Independent Bank and other defendants for their losses. The case was inactive due to a court-ordered discovery stay issued\nMarch 2, 2015 pending the Court\u2019s ruling on plaintiff\u2019s motion for class certification and designation of class representatives and counsel. On November 7, 2017, the Court issued an order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion. In addition, the Court lifted the previously ordered discovery stay. On January 11, 2018, the Court entered a scheduling order providing that the case be ready for trial on January 27, 2020. However, due to agreed upon extensions of discovery on July 25, 2019, the Court amended the scheduling order to now provide that the case be ready for trial on January 11, 2021. The Company has experienced an increase in legal fees associated with the defense of this claim and anticipates further increases in legal fees as the case proceeds to trial.\nIndependent Bank notified its insurance carriers of the claims made in the Second Amended Complaint. The insurance carriers have initially indicated that the claims are not covered by the policies or that a \u201closs\u201d has not yet occurred. Independent Bank pursued insurance coverage as well as reimbursement of defense costs through the initiation of litigation and other means. On November 6, 2018, the Company settled claims under its Financial Institutions Select Policy pursuant to which the Company received payment of an amount which is not material to the operations of the Company. The Company did not settle any claims under its Financial Institution Bond Policy.\nIndependent Bank believes that the claims made in this lawsuit are without merit and is vigorously defending this lawsuit. This is complex litigation involving a number of procedural matters and issues. As such, Independent Bank is unable to predict when this matter may be resolved and, given the uncertainty of litigation, the ultimate outcome of, or potential costs or damages arising from, this case.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nThe Company and Independent Bank are involved in a legal proceeding related to the acquisition of Bank of Houston in 2014.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.\nInterest Rate Risks\nOne of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings, supplemented by hedging activities as believed by us to be appropriate. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments as of December 31, 2019, of our expected long-term indebtedness and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Actual rates will vary. Additionally, the potential effect that the proposed LIBOR phaseout could have on our business and financial condition cannot yet be determined (see Item 1A - \"Risk Factors,\" Risks Related to our Indebtedness for further discussion). The one-month LIBOR and HIBOR rates as of December 31, 2019 of 1.76% and 2.68%, respectively, were used for all variable rate calculations in the table below.\nThe information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents as applicable.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 59.5% of our long-term debt was based on fixed rates. Based on our borrowings as of December 31, 2019, an assumed 100 basis point change in the variable rates would cause our annual interest expense to change by $42.6 million.\nIn order to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the Retail Term Loan, the Company entered into a five year interest rate collar with a notional value of $615.0 million. The interest rate collar establishes a range whereby the Company will pay the counterparty if one-month LIBOR falls below the established floor rate of 1.00%, and the counterparty will pay the Company if one-month LIBOR exceeds the ceiling rate of 3.75%.\nForeign Currency Risks\nThe currency delineated in Wynn Macau SA's concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.\nIf the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca are not linked to the U.S. dollar in the future, severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies may result. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.\nWe expect most of the revenues and expenses for any casino that we operate in Macau will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars or Macau patacas; however, a significant portion of our Wynn Macau, Limited and Wynn Macau SA debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rates resulting in weakening of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar could have materially adverse effects on our results, financial condition, and ability to service debt. Based on our balances as of December 31, 2019, an assumed 1% change in the U.S. dollar/Hong Kong dollar exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction gain/loss of $26.8 million.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary:\nWynn Macau SA is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. To accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions.\nThe analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen.\nAt December 31, 2019, our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $8.9 million compared to a net asset of $11.4 million at December 31, 2018. The change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in our foreign exchange portfolio.\nSince our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Indian rupee and the Argentine peso. Foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows.\nTo analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at December 31, 2019 and 2018, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOne of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. In these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. In the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we had outstanding contracts in place to swap portions of our variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt with an aggregate notional value of $200.0 million.\nTo analyze the effects of changing interest rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous one percent change in the interest rates from their levels at December 31, 2019 and 2018, with all other variables held constant.\nOur debt portfolio at December 31, 2019 is composed of 80 percent fixed-rate debt and 20 percent variable-rate debt. The variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2017 Term Loan Facility, Credit Facility, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. Changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways.\nBased on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at December 31, 2019, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by $6.4 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text provides a summary of the market risks faced by a company and the strategies used to manage them.

{"section": "ITEM 1 BUSINESS\nWe were incorporated in Nevada on January 23, 2004. In May 2011, Paul Tidwell became Chairman and President and introduced our business plan of researching the location of and salvaging sunken ships. The Company is currently actively considering and negotiating several projects that have been extensively researched by its President. Several trips, including to Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, have been taken or have been scheduled.\nOn November 21, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to assist a company in Singapore to recover a large shipment of tin from a sunken ship that is believed to be in the waters between Indonesia and Malaysia. The same investor that agreed to fund the Flor de la Mar project if contracts are signed, provided the $200,000 needed by the Company to participate in this contract. The salvage ship was fully equipped at the end of May 2018. After leaving the harbor in Singapore to commence the salvage recovery effort, the ship experienced unexpected mechanical problems that required it to return to harbor for repairs. Shortly after the repairs were completed, the seas in the area were hit with severe storms which limited the salvage ship\u2019s ability to reach the salvage area and required it to refuel in Malaysia. The salvage ship then commenced to the area of the seas outside the Philippines where one of the sunken ships is believed to be. However, the salvage ship had to return to harbor for additional repairs affecting navigation-related equipment. A decision was made to use a different ship which was equipped and left harbor in late February 2019.\nNo assurances can be given that the sunken ship will be found and, if found, will have the amount of recoverable tin that the parties to the contract are seeking.\n\u2003\nThe other projects being discussed and reviewed include:\n\uf0b7The right to undertake an exploration to find the Flor de la Mar, a Portuguese ship that sank in 1511 with a rumored large cargo of treasures.\n\uf0b7A program to salvage/recover shipwreck artifacts at various sites throughout Panay Island, Philippines.\n\uf0b7A program to salvage a Japanese submarine sunk during World War ll.\nThe contract/project discussions are being undertaken with a variety of people and entities, including Government officials outside the United States. Before any contract can be completed, the parties have to negotiate how the proceeds of any salvaged assets would be distributed. The likely outcome of these projects and discussions cannot be predicted at this time.\nCompetition\nThere are a number of other entities that seek to salvage sunken vessels. These firms generally have greater resources than do we. We believe that our competitive advantage comes from the extensive research done over a long period of time by our President. This research gives us strong indications as to the specific location and possible contents of targeted sunken vessels. It also provides knowledge as to the likelihood of claims by Governments, insurance companies and others with respect to any contents that are recovered.\nWe cannot predict whether the competitive advantages that we believe exist will result in success of our operations.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have no patents or trademarks.\nEmployees\nAs of April 30, 2019, we had one employee, Paul Tidwell, our President, who devotes fulltime to us.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates and foreign currencies. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe satellite communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific risks include the risk of increasing interest rates on short-term debt, for planned new fixed-rate long-term financings, for planned refinancings using long-term fixed-rate debt, and for existing variable-rate debt. The Company utilizes derivative instruments from time to time in order to reduce its exposure to the risk of interest-rate volatility.\nApproximately 83% of our debt, or $11.9 billion principal amount was fixed-rate debt as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, our fixed-rate debt increased to approximately 84% of our debt, or $12.3 billion principal amount. While our fixed-rate debt does not expose us to earnings risk when market interest rates change, such debt is subject to changes in fair value (see Note 11-Long-Term Debt for fair value disclosures for our long-term debt). Our sensitivity analyses indicate that based on the level of fixed-rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019, a 100 basis point decrease in market rates would result in an increase in fair value of this fixed-rate debt of approximately $369.3 million.\nWhile our variable-rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as interest rates change, it is not subject to changes in fair values. As of December 31, 2019, we held interest rate cap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2.4 billion that mature in February 2021. These contracts were entered into to mitigate our risk of interest rate increases on the floating rate term loans under our senior secured credit facilities. If LIBOR exceeds 1.89% prior to the expiration date of the contracts, the Company will receive the resulting increase in interest payments required to the term loan lenders from the counterparties to the arrangement. These interest rate cap contracts have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and the changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe do not currently use material foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposures. Substantially all of our customer contracts, capital expenditure contracts and operating expense obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, we are not exposed to material foreign currency exchange risk. However, the service contracts with our Brazilian customers provide for payment in Brazilian reais. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of a reduction in the value of the Brazilian real as compared to the U.S. dollar in connection with payments made by Brazilian customers, and our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate for Brazilian reais is ongoing. However, the rates payable under our service contracts with Brazilian customers are adjusted annually to account for inflation in Brazil, thereby mitigating the risk. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, our Brazilian customers represented approximately 4.0%, 3.3% and 2.4% of our revenue, respectively. Transactions in other currencies are converted into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on the dates of the transactions.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates and foreign currencies that the company is exposed to.

Realized prices are primarily driven by the prevailing global prices for oil and prices for natural gas and NGLs in the United States. Prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile for several years, and we expect this unpredictability to continue in the future. The prices that our operators receive for production depend on many factors outside of our or their control. To reduce the impact of fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices on our revenues, we use commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to price volatility of oil and natural gas. The counterparties to the contracts are unrelated third parties. The contracts settle monthly in cash based the difference between the fixed contract price and the market settlement price. The market settlement price is based on the NYMEX benchmark for oil and natural gas. We have not designated any of our contracts as fair value or cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of the contracts are included in net income in the period of the change. See Note 5 - Commodity Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nCommodity prices have declined in recent years. To estimate the effect lower prices would have on our reserves, we applied a 10% discount to the SEC commodity pricing for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Applying this discount results in an approximate 2% reduction of proved reserve volumes as compared to the undiscounted December 31, 2019 SEC pricing scenario.\nCounterparty and Customer Credit Risk\nOur derivative contracts expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. While we do not require our counterparties to our derivative contracts to post collateral, we do evaluate the credit standing of such counterparties as we deem appropriate. This evaluation includes reviewing a counterparty\u2019s credit rating and latest financial information. As of December 31, 2019, we had nine counterparties, all of which are rated Baa1 or better by Moody\u2019s and are lenders under our Credit Facility.\nOur principal exposure to credit risk results from receivables generated by the production activities of our operators. The inability or failure of our significant operators to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. However, we believe the credit risk associated with our operators and customers is acceptable.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have exposure to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had $394.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, bearing interest at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.05%. The impact of a 1% increase in the interest rate on this amount of debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense, and a corresponding decrease in our results of operations, of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, assuming that our indebtedness remained constant throughout the period. We may use certain derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates in the future, but we do not currently have any interest rate hedges in place.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks faced by a company, including commodity price risk, counterparty and customer credit risk, and interest rate risk. The company is exposed to commodity price risk due to the volatility of oil, natural gas, and NGLs prices, and uses commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure. The company also has exposure to credit risk from its derivative contracts and receivables from its operators, and believes the credit risk is acceptable. Lastly, the company has exposure to changes in interest rates on its indebtedness, and may use certain derivative instruments to hedge its exposure in the future."}

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nOther than disclosed below, we know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.\nEmployment Matters\nOn September 27, 2019, Dennis Forchic (the \u201cPlaintiff\u201d) filed a breach of contract case against the Company in the Los Angeles Superior Court of Los Angeles, California, under case number 19STCV34592, alleging that the Company wrongfully terminated the Plaintiff\u2019s employment agreement on February 5, 2018. The Plaintiff claims damages of $646,000 for unpaid severance, unpaid reimbursed expenses, and unpaid health benefits. In addition, the Plaintiff claims damages for failing to compensate Plaintiff for 3,000,000 stock options which vested on termination. On March 3, 2020, the Plaintiff was awarded a default judgment against the Company in the amount of $646,000, plus post judgment interest, as well as the vesting of options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. On September 25, 2020, the Company negotiated a settlement for a total cash consideration of $165,000.\nOn or about June 25, 2018, Matthew Geschke (the \u201cPlaintiff\u201d) filed a breach of contract case against the Company in the San Diego Superior Court of San Diego, California. The Plaintiff claimed damages for breach of an employment contract when the Company terminated the Plaintiff\u2019s employment agreement on February 22, 2018. On June 26, 2020, the Plaintiff was awarded a default judgment against the Company in the amount of $448,000. No payments were made during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLease Abandonment\nOn February 15, 2019, MSCP, L.L.C (\u201cMSCP\u201d), filed suit in the Superior Court of Arizona, County of Maricopa, Case No. CV2019-001613 against the Company and YLK. The case arises from YLK\u2019s alleged breach of a certain lease agreement dated May 19, 2018 (the \u201cLease\u201d), for the lease of certain real property located at 4301 W. Buckeye Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85043 (the \u201cPremises\u201d), between MSCP and YLK, which the Company guaranteed. MSCP filed the lawsuit after YLK provided a notice of termination for, amongst other reasons, MSCP\u2019s failure to disclose various material information regarding code, safety, structural and other issues in the Premises that rendered the Premises unsuitable for use, unless the Company undertook significant and extraneous costs that were not contemplated under the Lease to remedy said issues in and outside of the Premises. MSCP\u2019s complaint alleged counts for breach of lease and waste and breach of guaranty. MSCP is seeking compensatory damages, rents and other charges due under the lease, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The Company just recently filed its answer denying the allegations as well as having filed counterclaims for fraud in the inducement, negligent misrepresentation, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, rescission of contract, unjust enrichment and punitive damages. On December 12, 2019, MSCP was awarded a default judgment against the Company in the amount of $1,487,000, which is recorded as a charge to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. On September 11, 2020, the Company negotiated a settlement for a total consideration of $193,000, which were comprised of $150,000 in cash, and the issuance of 3,333,333 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock valued at $43,000, and recorded a gain on settlement of legal obligations of $1,441,000.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "This text describes three legal proceedings against the company.

{"section": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and other claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. The amount, if any, of ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, but despite the inherent uncertainties of litigation, management currently believes that the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings and exposure will not have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. Set forth below are material updates to legal proceedings of the Company.\nAs previously disclosed, on December 20, 2018, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a complaint in a putative class and derivative action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDelaware Court\u201d), captioned Robert Garfield v. BlackRock Mortgage Ventures, LLC et al., Case No. 2018-0917-KSJM (the \u201cGarfield Action\u201d). The Garfield Action alleges, among other things, that certain current directors and officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders by, among other things, agreeing to and entering into the Reorganization without ensuring that the Reorganization was entirely fair to the Company or public shareholders. The Reorganization was approved by 99.8% of voting shareholders on October 24, 2018. On December 19, 2019, the Delaware Court denied a motion to dismiss filed by the Company and certain of its directors and officers. Nevertheless, the Company continues to believe the Garfield Action is without merit and plans to vigorously defend the matter, which remains pending.\nOn November 5, 2019, Black Knight Servicing Technologies, LLC, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Black Knight, Inc. (\u201cBKI\u201d), filed a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial in the Circuit Court for the Fourth Judicial Circuit in and for Duval County, Florida, captioned Black Knight Servicing Technologies, LLC v. PennyMac Loan Services, LLC, Case No. 2019-CA-007908 (the \u201cBKI Complaint\u201d). Allegations contained within the BKI Complaint include breach of contract and misappropriation of MSP\u00ae System trade secrets in order to develop an imitation mortgage-processing system intended to replace the MSP\u00ae System. The BKI Complaint seeks damages for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets, injunctive relief under the Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act and declaratory judgment of ownership of all intellectual property and software developed by or on behalf of PLS as a result of its wrongful use of and access to the MSP\u00ae System and related trade secret and confidential information. On January 6, 2020, the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration, which has not yet been fully briefed or argued. The Company believes the BKI Complaint is without merit and plans to vigorously defend the matter, which remains pending.\nOn November 6, 2019, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PLS, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (the \u201cFederal Court\u201d), captioned PennyMac Loan Services, LLC v. Black Knight, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:19\u2212cv\u221209526 RGK (JEMx) (the \u201cPLS Complaint\u201d). The PLS Complaint alleges that BKI uses its market-dominating LoanSphere\u00ae MSP mortgage loan servicing system to engage in unfair business tactics that both entrap its licensees and create barriers to entry that stifle competition. The PLS Complaint further alleges that BKI violated the federal Sherman Act, the California Cartwright Act and California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law and engaged in unfair competition under common law. The Company seeks, among other relief, to preliminarily and permanently enjoin BKI\u2019s wrongful practices, and seeks the recovery of actual and statutory damages. On February 13, 2020, the Federal Court transferred the PLS complaint to the Middle District of Florida. The matter remains pending.\nItem 4.", "summary": "The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and other claims arising in the ordinary course of its business.

The Company believes all three lawsuits are without merit and plans to vigorously defend them."}
{"section": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nDynex Capital, Inc., which commenced operations in 1988, is an internally managed mortgage real estate investment trust, or mortgage REIT, which primarily invests in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d) on a leveraged basis. We finance our investments principally with borrowings under repurchase agreements. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term that are reflective of a leveraged, high quality fixed income portfolio with a focus on capital preservation. We seek to provide returns to our shareholders primarily through the payment of regular dividends and to a lesser extent through capital appreciation of our investments.\nOur investments consist primarily of Agency MBS including residential MBS (\u201cRMBS\u201d), commercial MBS (\u201cCMBS\u201d) and CMBS interest-only (\u201cIO\u201d) securities and non-Agency MBS, which consist mainly of CMBS IO. Agency MBS have an implicit guaranty of principal payment by an agency of the U.S. government or a U.S. government-sponsored entity (\u201cGSE\u201d) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Non-Agency MBS are issued by non-governmental enterprises and do not have a guaranty of principal payment.\nInvestment Strategy\nOur investment strategy and the allocation of our capital to a particular sector or investment is driven by a \u201ctop-down\u201d framework that focuses on the expected risk-adjusted outcome of any investment. Key points of this framework include the following:\n\u2022understanding macroeconomic conditions including the current state of the U.S. and global economies;\n\u2022understanding the regulatory environment, competition for assets, and the terms and availability of financing;\n\u2022sector analysis including understanding absolute returns, relative returns and risk-adjusted returns;\n\u2022security and financing analysis including sensitivity analysis on credit, interest rate volatility, and market value risk; and\n\u2022managing performance and inherent portfolio risks, including but not limited to interest rate, credit, prepayment, and liquidity risks.\nIn allocating our capital and executing our strategy, we seek to balance the risks of owning specific types of investments with the earnings opportunity on the investment. At various times during the last decade, we have allocated capital to a variety of investments including adjustable-rate and fixed-rate Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, investment grade and unrated non-Agency RMBS and CMBS, Agency and non-Agency CMBS IO, and residual interests in securitized mortgage loans. Our investments in non-Agency MBS are generally higher quality senior or mezzanine classes (typically rated 'A' or better by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) because they are typically more liquid (i.e., they are more easily converted into cash either through sales or pledges as collateral for repurchase agreement borrowings) and have less exposure to credit losses than lower-rated non-Agency MBS. We regularly review our existing operations to determine whether our investment strategy or business model should change, including through capital reallocation, changing our targeted investments, and shifting our risk position.\nThe performance of our investment portfolio will depend on many factors including but not limited to interest rates, trends of interest rates, the steepness of interest rate curves, prepayment rates on our investments, demand for our investments, general market liquidity, and economic conditions and their impact on the credit performance of our investments. In addition, our business model may be impacted by other factors such as the state of the overall credit markets, which could impact the availability and costs of financing.

These claims, actions and proceedings are at varying stages of investigation, arbitration, or adjudication, and involve a variety of areas of law. Time, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary, previously reported on, and we update below, the following legal proceedings.\nOn October 26, 2010, the Canadian Minister of National Revenue denied the claims by Time Inc. Retail (formerly Time/Warner Retail Sales & Marketing, Inc.) (TIR) for input tax credits in respect of goods and services tax that TIR had paid on magazines it imported into and had displayed at retail locations in Canada during the years 2006 to 2008, on the basis that TIR did not own those magazines and issued Notices of Reassessment in the amount of approximately C$52 million. On January 21, 2011, TIR filed an objection to the Notices of Reassessment with the Chief of Appeals of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), arguing that TIR claimed input tax credits only in respect of goods and services tax it actually paid and it is entitled to a rebate for such payments. On September 13, 2013, TIR received Notices of Reassessment in the amount of C$26.9 million relating to the same type of situation during the years 2009 to 2010, and TIR filed similar objections as for prior years. By letter dated June 19, 2015, the CRA requested payment of C$89.8 million, which includes interest accrued and stated that failure to pay may result in legal action. TIR responded by stating that collection should remain stayed pending resolution of the issues raised by TIR\u2019s objection. Including interest accrued, the total of the reassessments claimed by the CRA for the years 2006 to 2010 was C$91 million as of November 30, 2015. The parties are engaged in mediation.\nIn July 2017 and November 2017, Time received subpoenas from the Enforcement Division of the staff of the SEC requiring Time to provide documents relating to its accounting for goodwill and asset impairments, restructuring and severance costs, and its analysis and reporting of Time\u2019s segments. In April 2019, the Company received a letter from the SEC Division of Enforcement stating that it has concluded its investigation as to Time and it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the SEC against Time.\nOn September 6, 2019, a shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial Officer, seeking to represent a class of shareholders who acquired securities of the Company between May 10, 2018 and September 4, 2019. On September 12, 2019, a shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer, and its Chairman of the Board seeking to represent a class of shareholders who acquired securities of the Company between January 31, 2018 and September 5, 2019. Both complaints allege that the defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, and failed to disclose material adverse facts, about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Both complaints assert claims under the federal securities laws and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. The defendants have not yet responded to either complaint but intend to vigorously oppose them.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nA significant portion of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We seek to manage this foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities.\nFrom time to time, foreign exchange risk is managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations and from intercompany loans. Mylan\u2019s primary areas of foreign exchange risk relative to the U.S. Dollar are the Euro, Swedish Krona, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Pound Sterling and Brazilian Real. Any unhedged foreign exchange exposures continue to be subject to market fluctuations.\nOur financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. The fair values of these instruments were determined as follows:\n\u2022\nforeign currency forward-exchange contracts - net present values\n\u2022\nforeign currency denominated receivables, payables, debt and loans - changes in exchange rates\nIn this sensitivity analysis, we assumed that the change in one currency\u2019s rate relative to the U.S. Dollar would not have an effect on other currencies\u2019 rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. All other factors were held constant.\nIf there were an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10%, the expected net effect on net income related to Mylan\u2019s foreign currency denominated financial instruments would not be material.\nThe Company is also exposed to translation risk on non-U.S. dollar-denominated net assets. Non-U.S. dollar borrowings, principally our Euro denominated long-term debt, are used to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates and are designated as hedges of net investments. The foreign exchange gains or losses on these hedges is included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If our net investment decreases below the equivalent value of the non-U.S. debt borrowings, the change in the remeasurement basis of the debt would be subject to recognition in net income as changes occur.\nInterest Rate and Long-Term Debt Risk\nMylan\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from our U.S. Dollar and Euro borrowings and U.S. Dollar investments. We invest primarily on a variable-rate basis and we borrow on both a fixed and variable basis. In order to maintain a certain ratio of fixed to variable rate debt, from time to time, depending on market conditions, Mylan will use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to fix interest rates on variable-rate borrowings or to convert fixed-rate borrowings to variable interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Mylan\u2019s outstanding fixed rate borrowings consist principally of $12.2 billion notional amount of senior notes and Euro notes. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate senior notes and Euro notes was approximately $13.4 billion. A 100 basis point change in interest rates on Mylan\u2019s variable rate debt, net of interest rate swaps, would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $13.1 million per year.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Mylan is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and long-term debt risk.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe do not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure associated with our floating-rate debt under the credit facility. Under these interest rate swap contracts, we receive cash flows from counterparties at variable rates based on LIBOR and pay the counterparties a fixed rate. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, we only enter into contracts with selected major financial institutions with investment grade ratings and continually assess their creditworthiness. There are no credit risk-related contingent features in our interest rate swaps nor do the swaps contain provisions under which we would be required to post collateral.\nThe notional value, fixed rate of interest and expiration date of each interest rate swap is (i)$10 million - 1.120% - February, 2021, (ii) $20 million - 1.770% - May, 2022, (iii) $15 million - 2.640% - June, 2023 and (iv) $50 million - 0.885% - April, 2025. Refer to Note 6, Financial Instruments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding interest rate swaps.\nInterest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are different. A change in the Federal Funds Rate, or the reference rate set by Bank of America, N.A., would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds under our credit facility. Our balance outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2020 was $108.0 million, of which $13.0 million is subject to rate risk. If market rates were to increase or decrease 100 basis points from the levels at December 31, 2020, interest expense would increase or decrease approximately $0.1 million annually.\nIn connection with our payroll business, funds held for clients are segregated and invested in short-term investments, such as corporate and municipal bonds. In accordance with our investment policy, all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of the initial investment. At each respective balance sheet date, these investments are adjusted to fair value with fair value adjustments being recorded to other comprehensive income or\nloss for the respective period.

Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the local functional currency, will be reported in the functional currency at the applicable exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. A change in the value of the functional currency compared to the foreign currency of the transaction will have either a positive or negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nAssets and liabilities of our foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the applicable period. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Historically, our primary exposure has related to transactions denominated in the euro, British pound, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Indian rupee.\nPeriodically, we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As of September 30, 2019, we had not designated any contracts as fair value or cash flow hedges. The contracts generally have a maturity of less than 90 days. As of September 30, 2019, the notional contract amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was $189.6 million.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nAt September 30, 2019, we held approximately $764.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consisting of cash, money-market funds, bank deposits and a separately managed investment portfolio. Assuming a one percentage point increase in interest rates, our interest income on our investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities would increase by approximately $7.6 million per annum, based on the September 30, 2019 reported balances of our investment accounts.\nAt September 30, 2019, we had no outstanding debt exposed to variable interest rates.\nConvertible Debentures\nThe fair values of our convertible debentures are dependent on the price and volatility of our common stock as well as movements in interest rates. The fair market values of these debentures will generally increase as the market price of our common stock increases and will decrease as the market price of our common stock decreases. The fair market values of these debentures will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The market value and interest rate changes affect the fair market values of these debentures, but do not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. However, increases in the value of our common stock above the stated trigger price for each issuance for a specified period of time may provide the holders of these debentures the right to convert each bond using a conversion ratio and payment method as defined in the debenture agreement.\nThe following tables summarizes the fair value and conversion value of our convertible debentures, and the estimated increase in the fair value and conversion value with a hypothetical 10% increase in the stock price of $16.31 as of September 30, 2019 (dollars in millions):\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

Our prior business plans, which generated limited or no earnings, included interior decorating products, and a travel and tourism service.\nOn May 14, 2018, Richard Carey our President and Chairman of the Board, acquired 22,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, representing 62.15% ownership of the Company which constitutes control. Mr. Carey accepted the positions of President and Chairman of the Board on the same day.\nOn May 17, 2018, Mr. Carey appointed Alexei Tchernov as CEO and Director, Franz Allmayer as Vice President and Director, John C. Baird as CFO and Director and Themis Glatman as Secretary and Director. Also see Note 4.\nOn May 22, 2019, the Board discussed the positions of the Directors and Officers. Mr. Tchernov resigned his position as CEO and Themis Glatman resigned as Company Secretary. The new appointments were made as follows:\nIn August 14, 2018, the Company entered into an Exclusive Option Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Starving Lion, Inc. (\u201cLion\u201d). Under the Agreement, the Company has been granted the exclusive option, for a period of six (6) months, to acquire the assets from Starving Lion, Inc. specified under the June 4, 2018 Letter of Intent. The assets pertain mainly to two mines located in Guatemala; one is a magnesium mine in El Progresso, and the other is a gold mine in Livingston.\nThe required purchase price for the Starving Lion, Inc. assets will be $1,000,000 cash, together with the issuance to Lion of new common and/or preferred stock to represent fifty-eight percent (58%) of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted, post-closing basis. The Company decided not to proceed with this potential acquisition at this time.\nOn October 25, 2018, Star entered into a Letter of Intent (the \u201cLOI\u201d) with Troy Mining Corporation, a Nevada corporation (\u201cTroy\u201d) and its two majority shareholders and on March 25, 2019 and on August 5th this LOI was extended.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is exposed to market risk, including adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates.\nCommodity Price Risk - The Company produces and sells crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. As a result, the Company's operating results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices caused by changing market forces. The Company reduces its exposure to price volatility by hedging its production through swaps, options and other commodity derivative instruments. In a typical swap transaction, the Company will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, the Company is required to pay the counterparty the difference. In a typical option contract, the Company purchases the right to receive from the counterparty the difference, if any, between a fixed price specified in the option less a floating market price. If the floating price is above the fixed price, the Company is not entitled to a payment. The Company uses hedge accounting for these instruments, and settlements of gains or losses on these contracts are reported as a component of oil and gas revenues and operating cash flows in the period realized. These agreements expose the Company to counterparty credit risk to the extent that the counterparty is unable to meet its settlement commitments to the Company.\nThe Company follows formal policies regarding the management of oil price risk to ensure the Company's ability to optimally manage its portfolio of investment opportunities. To accomplish this, the policy requires that derivative financial instruments must be entered into at least 18 months in advance of the effective period. For 2001, the Company has entered into swap arrangements on 26,000 BOPD for the first quarter at an average WTI price of $19.52, for the second quarter on 25,000 BOPD at an average WTI price of $19.54, for the third quarter on 20,000 BOPD at an average WTI price of $21.22, and for the fourth quarter on 15,500 BOPD at an average WTI price of $22.95 per barrel. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the Company entered into swaps on an additional 1,200 BOPD for the second quarter, bringing the total to 26,200 BOPD at an average price of $19.84 per barrel. On a physical volume basis, these hedges cover 47% of the Company's estimated 2001 oil production. At December 31, 2000, the market value of the swaps in place for 2001 was a loss of $35.1 million. A 10% increase in the underlying commodity prices would increase this loss by $19.7 million.\nFor 2002, the Company has entered into swap arrangements on 12,500 BOPD for the first quarter at an average WTI price of $25.91 per barrel. For the remainder of 2002, the Company purchased put options with a WTI strike price of $22.00 per barrel, on 19,000 BOPD for the second quarter, and on 14,000 BOPD for both the third and fourth quarters. At December 31, 2000, the market value of these hedge positions for 2002 is a gain of $8.3 million. A 10% increase in the underlying commodity prices would reduce this gain by $2.6 million.\nInterest Rate Risk - The Company may enter into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage the impact of changes in interest rates. The Company's exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short-term and long-term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates.

Legal Proceedings\nDomestic Wallboard Antitrust Litigation\nSince late December 2012, several purported class action lawsuits were filed in various federal district courts, against the Company\u2019s subsidiary, American Gypsum Company LLC (American Gypsum) and other wallboard manufacturers, alleging that the defendant wallboard manufacturers conspired to fix the price for drywall sold in the United States in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in some cases related provisions of state law. The Company and American Gypsum denied all allegations that they conspired to increase the price of drywall and asserted affirmative defenses to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\nOn December 29, 2017, American Gypsum and the Company, entered into a settlement agreement (the Direct Purchaser Settlement Agreement) with counsel representing the direct purchaser class to settle all claims made against the Company, American Gypsum, and other manufacturers in the direct purchaser class action. The Direct Purchaser Settlement Agreement, in which the Company and American Gypsum deny all wrongdoing, also includes releases by the participating class members of the Company and American Gypsum as well as their subsidiaries, affiliates, and other related parties, for the time period from January 1, 2012, through the date of execution of the Direct Purchaser Settlement Agreement. On January 5, 2018, American Gypsum entered into a settlement agreement (the Indirect Purchaser Settlement Agreement) with counsel representing the indirect purchaser class to settle all claims against American Gypsum and the other manufacturers in the indirect purchaser class action. Under the Direct and Indirect Purchaser Settlement Agreements, the Company and American Gypsum agreed to pay a total of approximately $39.1 million in cash to settle the claims against them. These claims were accrued during March 2018, and we deposited approximately $38.8 million into a qualified settlement fund. The amount accrued under the Direct Purchaser Settlement Agreement was paid in July 2018 after approval by the District Court.\nIn March 2015, a group of homebuilders filed a complaint against the defendants, including American Gypsum, based upon the same conduct alleged in the consolidated class action complaints. Effective May 8, 2018, American Gypsum and the homebuilder plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement (the Homebuilder Settlement Agreement) to settle all claims made against American Gypsum. The Homebuilder Settlement Agreement, in which American Gypsum denies all wrongdoing, includes releases by the homebuilder plaintiffs of American Gypsum as well as its subsidiaries, affiliates, and other related parties, for the time period prior to and including the date of execution of the Homebuilder Settlement Agreement. Under the Homebuilder Settlement Agreement, American Gypsum agreed to pay a total of $6.0 million in cash to settle the claims against it. At March 31, 2018, we accrued the total amount of this settlement, and this amount was paid in May 2018.\nIn June 2015, American Gypsum and an employee received grand jury subpoenas from the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina seeking information regarding an investigation of the gypsum drywall industry by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe had cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $319.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. agency securities, U.S. treasury, municipal bonds, commercial paper, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and money market funds. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities, while limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the U.S. government. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our cash and cash equivalents or marketable investments.\nIn May 2018, we issued $258.8 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes. The fair value of the convertible senior notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the conversion feature. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of the convertible senior notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Additionally, we carry the convertible senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and, therefore, our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk. However, we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk. A stronger U.S. dollar could make our solution more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. Such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of currency fluctuations.\nOur operating expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, except for Russia where compensation of our employees is primarily denominated in the U.S. dollar. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the potential loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, marketable debt security prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in interest rates, marketable debt security prices and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have and will have an impact on our results of operations.\nInterest rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2019, we have $72.0 million and $48.8 million of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings, respectively, subject to changes in interest rates. A 200-basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by less than $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We do not expect any changes in interest rates to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations during the remainder of 2020. The interest rate charged on our domestic secured line of credit facility is based on the prime rate of interest, our domestic distribution center loan is based on the one month LIBOR and our China DC Loan is based on a reference rate provided by the People\u2019s Bank of China. Changes in these interest rates will have an effect on the interest charged on outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2019, there was no amount outstanding under our domestic credit facility, $63.7 million outstanding on our domestic distribution center loan and $51.3 million on our China DC Loan.\nWe have entered into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on our long-term debt. We will not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. We had one derivative instrument in place as of December 31, 2019 to hedge the cash flows on our $63.7 million variable rate debt on our domestic distribution center. This instrument was a variable to fixed derivative with a notional amount of $63.7 million at December 31, 2019. Our average receive rate was one month LIBOR and the average pay rate was 2.08%. The rate swap agreement utilized by us effectively modifies our exposure to interest rate risk by converting our floating-rate debt to a fixed rate basis over the life of the loan, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate changes on future interest expense.\nForeign exchange rate fluctuations. We face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries\u2019 revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates may affect the value of our inventory commitments. Also, inventory purchases of our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers, which could have the effect of increasing the cost of goods sold in the future. We manage these risks by primarily denominating these purchases and commitments in U.S. dollars. We do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risks.\nAssets and liabilities outside the United States are located in regions where we have subsidiaries or joint ventures: Asia, Central America, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South America. Our investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are generally considered long-term. Accordingly, we do not hedge these net investments. The fluctuation of foreign currencies resulted in a cumulative foreign currency translation gain of $1.5 million and a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $16.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders\u2019 equity.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS\nThe tables below provide information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitute \"forward-looking statements.\" All items described are non-trading.\nOur major market risk exposure is changing interest rates, primarily in the United States. Due to our limited foreign operations, we do not have material market risk exposures relative to changes in foreign exchange rates. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. We use interest rate derivatives to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based upon market conditions. These derivatives consist of interest rate caps and floors which we enter into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. We use variable to fixed interest rate caps and floors to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt. Maturity dates for variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, caps and floors are based upon contractual maturity dates. Average pay rates under interest rate swaps are based upon contractual fixed rates. Average variable receive rates under interest rate swaps are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. Average rates under interest rate caps and floors are based upon contractual rates.\nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate current market rates. The fair value of interest rate caps and floors is determined from valuation models which are then compared to dealer quotations and represents the discounted future cash flows through maturity or expiration using current rates, and is effectively the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined from dealer quotations and represents the discounted future cash flows through maturity or expiration using current rates, and is effectively the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements.\nSeparately, during the first quarter of 2001 the Federal Reserve lowered its key lending rates. Lower interest rates are generally favorable to our operating results but they will affect the valuation of our derivatives. Changes in fair value of our stand-alone caps due to movements in interest rates or changing market conditions will be reflected currently in earnings and as such will add volatility to net income and earnings per share in future periods.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks associated with the company's financial instruments, which are primarily related to changing interest rates in the United States.

We have been able to partially offset cost increases resulting from a number of factors, including market conditions, shortages or interruptions in supply due to weather or other conditions beyond our control, governmental regulations and inflation, by increasing our menu prices, as well as making other operational adjustments that increase productivity. However, substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be offset by menu price increases or operational adjustments.\nInflation Risk\nThe primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and beverage costs, labor costs, and energy costs. Our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state minimum wage and other laws governing such matters as working conditions, overtime and tip credits. Significant numbers of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates related to the federal and/or state minimum wage and, accordingly, increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs. To the extent permitted by competition and the economy, we have mitigated increased costs by increasing menu prices and may continue to do so if deemed necessary in future years. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed through to our guests. Historically, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of core operating resources by gradually increasing menu prices, coupled with more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent. There can be no assurance that future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our guests without any resulting change to their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate the same sales growth in an amount sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks associated with the company's profitability, including commodity and food price risks, inflation risks, and the potential for competitive conditions to limit menu pricing flexibility.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities, including corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit and term deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, and U.S. government and agency securities. The risk\nassociated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio. A 10% decrease in interest rates in 2019, 2018 and 2017 would have resulted in an insignificant decrease in our interest income in each of these periods.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk. However, a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the United States are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Canadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d), the Brazilian real (\u201cBRL\u201d), the Euro (\u201cEUR\u201d) and the British pound (\u201cGBP\u201d). To help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to minimize the impact of balance sheet items denominated in CAD. We do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes. All of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the credit worthiness of these parties. These contracts typically have a maturity of one month and settle on the last day of each month. We record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts in Other income (expense)-net in the consolidated statements of income. We recognized an expense of $4.7 million in 2019 due to foreign currency transaction losses.\nOur use of forward exchange contracts is intended to reduce, but not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. Our forward exchange contracts are relatively short-term in nature and are focused on the CAD. Long-term material changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, such as the EUR, BRL and GBP, could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future. We assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For foreign currency exchange rate risk, a 10% increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a $5.6 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash balances as of December 31, 2019.\nInflation Risk\nOur monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, are not affected significantly by inflation because they are predominantly short-term. We believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations. The rate of inflation, however, affects our cost of revenue and expenses, such as those for employee compensation, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThis text discusses the market risks associated with the company's investment activities.

At December 31, 2000, the Company had $151,125 of variable rate debt tied to LIBOR. In addition, the Company had $235,880 in variable tax-exempt debt tied to \"AAA\" NON-AMT. In addition, the Company has interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity. The discussion in this Interest Rate Sensitivity section is the same for the Company and the Operating Partnership, except that all indebtedness described herein has been incurred by the Operating Partnership.\nManagement has and will continue to manage interest rate risk as follows:\n- - maintain a conservative ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level;\n- - fix certain long-term variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps with appropriately matching maturities;\n- - use treasury locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and\n- - take advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.\nManagement uses various financial models and advisors to achieve these objectives.\nThe table below provides information about the Company's derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by (expected) contractual maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the Company's reporting currency.\n(1) Interest on these debt instruments is based on LIBOR ranging from LIBOR plus .675% to .750% above LIBOR. At December 31, 2000, the LIBOR rate was 6.561%. See Schedule of Indebtedness in Management's Discussion and Analysis for rates on individual debt instruments.\n(2) Assumes the Company's Revolver and Cash Management Line are repaid at the maturity date. Management believes these lines will be renewed at maturity with similar terms. Maturity dates reflect new terms which are effective January 12, 2001.\n(3) In December 2000, the Company entered into a swap transaction that fixed the rate on the note at 6.975%, inclusive of credit enhancement and other fees, from January 1, 2001 through July 31, 2009.\n(4) At December 31, 2000, the \"AAA\" NON-AMT rate was 5.00%.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of its ongoing business operations and the Company uses derivative financial instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. The Company, as a matter of policy, does not engage in trading or speculative transactions. See Note A - \"Significant Accounting Policies\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial statements.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases and sales, intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans. The Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, the Company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. Dollars. Primary exposures include the U.S. Dollars versus functional currencies of the Company's major markets which include the Euro, the British Pound, the German Mark, the French Franc, the Irish Punt, the Italian Lira and the Australian Dollar. The Company assesses foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and identifies naturally offsetting positions and purchases hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures. At December 31, 2000, the Company had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of $20.3 million. The fair market value of these arrangements, which represents the cost to settle these contracts, was an asset of approximately $1.3 million at December 31, 2000.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposure includes movements in the U.S. prime rate and London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\"). The Company uses interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate volatility. At December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately $257 million of interest rate swaps fixing interest rates between 5.44% and 9.66%. The fair market value of these arrangements, which represents the cost to settle these contracts, was a liability of approximately $0.4 million at December 31, 2000.\nAt December 31, 2000, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis for the Company's derivatives and other financial instruments that have interest rate risk. The Company calculated the pretax earnings effect on its interest sensitive instruments. Based on this sensitivity analysis, the Company has determined that an increase of 10% in the Company's weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2000 would have increased interest expense by approximately $4 million in 2000.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe Company is exposed to certain market risks, such as foreign exchange and interest rate volatility, which it manages through the use of derivative financial instruments.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the value of our marketable securities and inflation.\nAs of August 31, 2019, we had $3.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $25.2 million in short and long term bank deposits and $5.0 million in marketable securities.\nWe aim to preserve our financial assets, maintain adequate liquidity and maximize return while minimizing exposure to market risks. Such policy further provides that we should hold most of our current assets in bank deposits. As of today, the currency of our financial assets is mainly in U.S. dollars.\nMarketable securities\nWe own 10,208,144 common shares of D.N.A and 117,000 ordinary shares of Entera, which are presented in our financial statements as marketable securities. Marketable securities are presented at fair value and their realization is subject to certain limitations if sold through the market, and we are therefore exposed to market risk. There is no assurance that at the time of sale of the marketable securities the price per share will be the same or higher, nor that we will be able to sell all of the securities at once given the volume of securities we hold. Entera shares are traded on Nasdaq in U.S. dollars, while D.N.A shares are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and the D.N.A shares\u2019 price is denominated in NIS. We are also exposed to changes in the market price of the Entera and D.N.A shares, as well as to exchange rates fluctuations in the NIS currency compared to the U.S. dollar with respect to the D.N.A shares.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe invest a major portion of our cash surplus in bank deposits in banks in Israel. Since the bank deposits typically carry fixed interest rates, financial income over the holding period is not sensitive to changes in interest rates, but only the fair value of these instruments. However, our interest gains from future deposits may decline in the future as a result of changes in the financial markets. In any event, given the historic low levels of the interest rate, we estimate that a further decline in the interest rate we are receiving will not result in a material adverse effect to our business.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk and Inflation\nA significant portion of our expenditures, including salaries, clinical research expenses, consultants\u2019 fees and office expenses relate to our operations in Israel. The cost of those Israeli operations, as expressed in U.S. dollars, is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in Israel is not offset (or is offset on a lagging basis) by a devaluation of the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar declines in value in relation to the NIS, it will become more expensive for us to fund our operations in Israel. In addition, as of August 31, 2019, we own net balances in NIS of approximately $717,000. Assuming a 10% appreciation of the NIS against the U.S. dollar, we would experience exchange rate gain of approximately $80,000, while assuming a 10% devaluation of the NIS against the U.S. dollar, we would experience an exchange rate loss of approximately $65,000.\nThe exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the NIS, based on exchange rates published by the Bank of Israel, was as follows:\nWe do not use any currency hedging transactions of options or forwards to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the NIS.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe company is exposed to a variety of market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the value of marketable securities, and inflation.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to borrowings under our Amended Cash Flow Revolver as the interest rate we pay for borrowings is determined at the time of borrowing based on a floating index. Although we can elect to fix the interest rate at the time of borrowing, the facility does expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. An immediate 10 percent change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business in foreign currencies. Our foreign exchange policy requires that we take certain steps to limit our foreign exchange exposures resulting from certain assets and liabilities and forecasted cash flows. However, our policy does not require us to hedge all foreign exchange exposures. Furthermore, our foreign currency hedges are based on forecasted transactions and estimated balances, the amount of which may differ from that actually incurred. As a result, we can experience foreign exchange gains and losses in our results of operations.\nOur primary foreign currency cash flows are in certain Asian and European countries, Israel, Brazil and Mexico. We enter into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These contracts generally have maturities of up to two months, although we currently have a four-year contract that hedges a non-functional currency denominated note payable due in 2020. These forward contracts are not designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 28, 2019, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to exchange various foreign currencies for U.S. dollars in the aggregate notional amount of $299 million.\nWe also utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational (\u201ccash flow\u201d) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from (1) forecasted sales denominated in currencies other than those used to pay for materials and labor, (2) forecasted non-functional currency labor and overhead expenses, (3) forecasted non-functional currency operating expenses, and (4) anticipated capital expenditures denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity making the expenditures. These contracts may be up to twelve months in duration and are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the contracts is recorded in stockholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. We had forward contracts related to cash flow hedges in various foreign currencies in the aggregate notional amount of $107 million as of September 28, 2019.\nThe net impact of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates would not be material to our consolidated financial statements, provided we accurately forecast and estimate our foreign currency exposure.

Basanite and its wholly owned subsidiaries are herein referred to as the \"Company\", \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, or \u201cus\u201d. Currently based in Pompano Beach, Florida, the Company intends to manufacture concrete-reinforcing products made from basalt fiber reinforced polymers (\u201cBFRP\u201d), such as its primary product BasaFlex. This UV-stable, chemical, acid and moisture resistant material is sustainable and environmentally friendly and has been engineered to replace steel as it never rusts, therefore, addressing the industry\u2019s current corrosion issues. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis section for more details.\nCompetition\nThe market for the manufacture and sale of construction related products is one of the largest markets in the world. Our Basanite products for reinforcement of concrete compete as replacements for traditional steel and other fiber reinforced polymers (\u201cFRP\u201d) industry established products. The steel industry is very mature and entrenched with our potential customers and the specifying community. Accordingly, our business competes with large, established steel companies that have large and established wholesale and retail distribution networks. Most of our competitors are large and have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than our company. We also compete with other manufacturers of products often marketed as \u201calternatives\u201d to steel, including manufacturers of fiberglass, and other types of fiber products. Many of these players also have substantially greater resources than our company.\nWhile we believe that our products are unique and create a new segment within the concrete reinforcement industry, we still expect to compete with these large companies, both inside and outside of the United States, as they aggressively market their existing products, as well as any new products they may be developing that are competitive to ours.\nGovernmental Regulation\nBasalt fiber reinforced polymer rebar is subject to various testing and certifications from various private and public entities, such as the Department of Transportation and the US Army Corps of Engineers, in order to satisfy regulatory requirements for use as concrete reinforcement. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure such approvals and certifications in the future. Furthermore, we are dependent on third party independent groups, such as universities or other certifying bodies, to obtain approvals and certifications. Inability to secure approvals and certifications could materially harm our ability to generate revenue.\nEmployees\nAt December 31, 2018, we had four full time employees, all of which are employed for the continuing operations of the Company. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, nor governed by any collective bargaining agreements. We consider relations with our labor force as satisfactory.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had ten full time employees, all of which are employed for the continuing operations of the Company.

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, principally interest rates on fixed rate investments. For a discussion of the Company's investment portfolio and the management of that portfolio to reflect the nature of the underlying insurance obligations of the Company's insurance subsidiaries, please refer to the section entitled \"Investment of Assets\" in Item 1 of this report and the information set forth in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investments.\"\nThe following is a discussion of the Company's primary market risk sensitive instruments. It should be noted that this discussion has been developed using estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those described below. Further, the following discussion does not take into account actions which could be taken by management in response to the assumed changes in market rates. In addition, the discussion does not take into account other types of risks which may be involved in the business operations of the Company, such as the reinsurance recoveries on reinsurance treaties with third party insurers.\nThe primary market risk to the Company's investment portfolio is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the Company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates.\nInterest Rate Risk . The Company manages the interest rate risk inherent in our assets relative to the interest rate risk inherent in our liabilities. Generally, we manage interest rate risk based on the application of a commonly used model. The model projects the impact of interest rate changes on a range of factors, including duration and potential prepayment. For example, assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, the net hypothetical loss in fair market value related to the financial instruments segment of the Company's balance sheet is estimated to be $21.1 million at December 31, 2000 and $23.3 million at December 31, 1999. For purposes of the foregoing estimate, the following categories of the Company's fixed income investments were taken into account: (i) fixed maturities, including fixed maturities available for sale, (ii) short-term investments and (iii) notes receivable from affiliates. The market value of such assets was $606.0 million at December 31, 2000 and $639.5 million at December 31, 1999.\nThe fixed income investments of the Company include certain mortgage-backed securities. The market value of such securities was $223.4 million at December 31, 2000 and $208 million at December 31, 1999. Assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, the net hypothetical loss in the fair market value related to such mortgage-backed securities is estimated to be $11.1 million at December 31, 2000 and $12.0 million at December 31, 1999.\nSeparate account assets have not been included, since gains and losses on those assets generally accrue to the policyholders.\nThe Company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A of ILCO's annual report discusses the company's exposure to market risk, primarily interest rate risk.

In addition, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of new store openings, the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores, weather fluctuations, merchandise mix, demand for merchandise driven by local interest in sporting events, and the timing of sales tax holidays and annual income tax refunds.\nAlthough our operations are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that, historically, inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations as we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are subject to market risk. Market risk includes risk that arise from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies in which we invest; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; legislative reform; local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability; and interest rate fluctuations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing internals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. Our net investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates including LIBOR and prime rates. However, the interest rates on our December 2022 Notes are fixed for the life of such debt. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk and determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. As of March 31, 2019, we were not a party to any hedging arrangements.\nAs of March 31, 2019, approximately 94.7% of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at floating rates, of which 87.8% were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates could increase our net investment income by a maximum of $2.8 million, or $0.16 per share, on an annual basis. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates could decrease our net investment income by a maximum of $2.5 million, or $0.14 per share, on an annual basis. Our Credit Facility bears interest on a per annum basis equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus 2.50%, subject to certain conditions as outlined in the Credit Agreement. We pay unused commitment fees of 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, based on utilization.\nAlthough we believe that the foregoing analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in our portfolio. It also does not adjust for other business developments, including future borrowings that could affect the net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. It also does not assume any repayments from borrowers. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above.\nBecause we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the future, money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: We are subject to market risk, including risk from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market changes.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.\nAs of January 27, 2019, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $8 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $7 million, respectively.\nIn fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\nRefer to Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks associated with investments and interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and the use of foreign currency forward contracts.

The lawsuit seeks return of company emails and other electronic materials in the possession of the defendants, company control over the process by which the company\u2019s documents are identified, and a court judgment that the property is the Company\u2019s. Mr. and Mrs. Pappas have returned certain company documents that they have identified, but other issues remain. On December 11, 2017, Brian Pappas filed a counterclaim alleging the Company is required to indemnify him for a multitude of matters. The Company denies the allegation and is actively litigating this matter.\nIn a separate suit, filed on March 7, 2016 in the state court in St. John\u2019s County, Florida (Case No. CA 16-236), Franventures, LLC (\u201cFV\u201d) alleged that it is due an unstated amount of money from the Company pursuant to a contract the Company had previously terminated. On June 23, 2016, the Company filed a counterclaim against Franventures, which also included a complaint against former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Brian Pappas. The counterclaim seeks damages for losses and expenditures caused by alleged fraud, conversion of company assets, and breaches of fiduciary duty that the Company alleges that defendants perpetrated upon the Company, which the Company alleges occurred in part, while Mr. Pappas was serving as the Chief Executive Officer of CLC and as a member of its board of directors. The Company is actively litigating this matter. On October 27, 2016, Brian Pappas filed a motion to amend the complaint to add a claim alleging that the Company slandered him by virtue of a press release issued on or about August 1, 2016, in which the Company reported to shareholders on steps it had taken and improvements it had implemented. The motion has still not been ruled upon by the Court. If Mr. Pappas does amend his complaint, the Company will vigorously defend the proposed claim. The Company is actively litigating this matter.\nOn February 24, 2017, franchisee, Team Kasa, LLC, along with its three owners, filed suit in the Eastern District of New York (Case No. 2:17-cv-01074) against former CEO Brian Pappas, and Franventures. The same plaintiffs also initiated arbitration on the same issues (American Arbitration Association, Case No. 01-17-0001-1968), alleging the Company is jointly and severally liable for damages resulting from the allegations against Mr. Pappas and Franventures. The Company is contesting the allegations and its liability for any damages.

The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company is also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of the common stock.\nForeign Currency\nIn the normal course of business, the Company actively manages the exposure of foreign currency exchange rate market risk by entering into financial instruments with highly rated counterparties. The Company\u2019s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar against various currencies. The Company receives Euros for certain products sold to European customers and receives Canadian dollars for certain products sold to Canadian customers. The Yen and Renminbi are used to purchase engines from the Company's joint venture in Japan and the Company's subsidiary in China, respectively. The Company's foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are also influenced by fluctuations of local currencies, including the Australian dollar and Brazilian Real, against the U.S. dollar as these subsidiaries purchase components and inventory from vendors and the parent in U.S. dollars. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to partially hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations.\nAt June 30, 2019, the Company had the following forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with the notional value shown in local currency and the fair value and fair value (gains) losses shown in U.S. dollars (in thousands):\nAmounts invested in the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at fiscal year-end.

The Company has established programs to manage commodity price fluctuations through financial and physical contracts. The maturities of these contracts coincide with the expected usage of the commodities for periods up to the next thirty-six months.\nAt June 30, 2019 the Company had the following outstanding commodity derivative contracts with the fair value (gains) losses shown (in thousands):\nInterest Rates\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings, depending on general economic conditions. On June 30, 2019, long-term loans consisted of the following (in thousands):\nThe Senior Notes carry a fixed rate of interest and are therefore not subject to market fluctuation.\nThe Company enters into interest rate swaps to manage a portion of its interest rate risk from financing certain dealer and distributor inventories through third party financing sources.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe fair value of our mortgages payable is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. Discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages payable, using a rate of 3.67% at December 31, 2019, and rates ranging from 4.62% to 4.64% at December 31, 2018. Mortgages payable, exclusive of debt included in liabilities associated with assets held for sale, net, with book values of $96,926,000 and $386,923,000 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, have fair values of $99,764,000 and $377,364,000, respectively.\nOur future income, cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We are exposed to market risk in the form of changes in interest rates and the potential impact such changes may have on the cash flows from our\nfloating rate debt or the fair values of our fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 (excluding premiums, discounts, and deferred loan costs, including debt included in liabilities associated with assets held for sale, net, and before the impact of interest rate swaps, as applicable), $97,100,000 (or 31.2%) and $416,300,000 (or 66.8%) of our debt, respectively, was fixed rate mortgage loans, and $214,504,000 (or 68.8%) and $206,604,000 (or 33.2%), respectively, was floating rate borrowings. Based on the level of floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and before the impact of the interest rate swaps, as applicable, a 12.5 basis point change in LIBOR would result in an annual impact to our earnings of approximately $268,000 and $258,000, respectively. We calculate interest rate sensitivity by multiplying the amount of floating rate debt by the respective change in rate. The sensitivity analysis does not take into consideration possible changes in the balances or fair value of our floating rate debt or the impact of interest rate swaps, as applicable.\nIn order to manage financing costs and interest rate exposure related to our one-month LIBOR indexed variable rate borrowings, on August 13, 2015, we entered into ten interest rate swap agreements with multiple counterparties totaling $385,000,000 of notional value. These swap agreements became effective on November 2, 2015. These interest rate swaps effectively converted the interest rate on our one-month LIBOR indexed variable rate interest payments into a fixed weighted average rate of 1.563% plus the credit spread, which was 1.55% at December 31, 2018, or an all-in rate of 3.11%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repaid $215,000,000 of outstanding one-month LIBOR indexed variable rate borrowings and we terminated seven interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $215,000,000, for which we received termination payments, net of fees, of $973,000. On December 28, 2018, we repaid $40,000,000 of outstanding one-month LIBOR indexed variable rate borrowings and we terminated one interest rate swap with a notional value of $50,000,000, for which we received a termination payment, net of fees, of $684,000.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities and the conduct of operations by our subsidiaries in different foreign countries. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investment activities, which include investments in fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. We manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from interest rate risk. We have achieved this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term to maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates and (iii) entering into interest rate swap arrangements when we deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2019, our debt is comprised of the following amounts:\nQurate Retail is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related primarily to the monetary assets and liabilities and the financial results of QVC's foreign subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the statements of operations are generally translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses, which are reflected in income as unrealized (based on period-end translations) or realized upon settlement of the transactions. Cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the period. Accordingly, Qurate Retail may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. QVC's reported Adjusted OIBDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been impacted by approximately $5 million for every 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar.\nII-22\nWe periodically assess the effectiveness of our derivative financial instruments. With regard to interest rate swaps, we monitor the fair value of interest rate swaps as well as the effective interest rate the interest rate swap yields, in comparison to historical interest rate trends. We believe that any losses incurred with regard to interest rate swaps would be largely offset by the effects of interest rate movements on the underlying debt facilities. These measures allow our management to evaluate the success of our use of derivative instruments and to determine when to enter into or exit from derivative instruments.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

The increase in the loss from $176,033 in 2018 to $1,717,376 in 2019 was the major factor in the increased use of cash.\nCash used in financing activities as of September 30, 2018 was $32,448 which was the repayment of advances from related parties compared to cash provided of $695,554 in 2019 from the proceeds from the sale of common stock for cash of $323,643 plus proceeds from convertible debt and note payable of $329,000 and advances from related party of $15,911.\nWe do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with amounts to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders or other investors.\nWe believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholder plus the placement of common stock for cash.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nContractual Obligations\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.\nItem 7A:", "summary": "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides an overview of the Company's financial statements and results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and security investments. Changes in these factors may cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and manage the exposure to these market risks as follows:\nFixed Income Investments. We have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term marketable investments securities of $169.0 million as of December 31, 2000. These securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations. An increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities.\nWe do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk. We limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk, however, by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. The primary objective of these policies is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $607,000 decrease (approximately 0.4%) in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2000.\nForeign Exchange Rates. Due to our reliance on international and export sales, we are subject to the risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Because a substantial majority of our international and export revenues are typically denominated in United States dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country, leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country. Our subsidiaries in the U.K. and Japan operate in their local currency, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to the respective currency royalties collected.\nStrategic Investments. We have expanded our technological base in current as well as new markets through strategic investments in companies, technologies, or products. We currently hold minority equity interests in CAC, Digimarc, AudioSoft, TTR Technologies, SecureMedia and InterActual. These investments, totaling $53.3 million, represented 17.8% of our total assets as of December 31, 2000. CAC, AudioSoft, SecureMedia and InterActual are privately held companies. There is no active trading market for their securities and our investments in them are illiquid. We may never have an opportunity to realize a return on our investment in these private companies, and we may in the future be required to write off all or part of one or more of these investments.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nRealNetworks is exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security investments.

{"section": "Item 7 A- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nNRG South Central may use interest rate hedging contracts to mitigate the risks associated with movements in interest rates and, when deemed appropriate, may enter into swap agreements effectively converting floating rate obligations into fixed rate obligations. NRG South Central and its subsidiaries have primarily fixed rate long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2000. As a result, NRG South Central is not significantly exposed to losses due to fluctuations in interest rates.\nCommodity Price Risk\nNRG South Central is exposed to commodity price variability in electricity, emission allowances and natural gas and coal used to meet fuel requirements. To manage earnings volatility associated with these commodity price risks, NRG South Central, through its affiliate NRG Power Marketing, enters into commodity contracts, which may take the form of fixed price, floating price or indexed forward sales or purchases, swaps, and options, such as puts, calls and basis transactions.\nThrough NRG Power Marketing, NRG South Central utilizes a \u201cValue-at-Risk\u201d (VAR) model to determine the maximum potential three-day loss in the fair value of the commodity price related financial instruments. The VAR for NRG South Central assumes a 95% confidence interval and reflects NRG South Central\u2019s merchant strategy, the generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions of NRG South Central. The volatility estimate is based on a lognormal calculation of closing prices for the latest 30 days for forward markets where NRG South Central has exposure. This model encompasses the Entergy region.\nThe estimated maximum potential three-day loss in fair value of the commodity price related financial instruments, calculated using the VAR model is approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.\nCredit Risk\nNRG South Central is exposed to credit risk in its risk management activities. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counter party of its contractual obligations. Through NRG Energy\u2019s Treasury department, NRG South Central maintains credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitors these policies to reflect changes in scope of operations.

Legal Proceedings\nOn January 31, 2017, a putative class action complaint was filed by Baran Polat in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, or District Court, against us, Paul C. Grint (our former Chief Executive Officer), and Joseph P. Hagan (then our Chief Operating Officer and currently our President and Chief Executive Officer). The complaint includes claims asserted, on behalf of certain purchasers of our securities, under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In general, the complaint alleges that, between January 21, 2016, and June 27, 2016, the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements regarding our business and the prospects for RG-101, thereby artificially inflating the price of our securities. The plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief. On February 10, 2017, a second putative class action complaint was filed by Li Jin in the District Court against the Company, Mr. Hagan, Dr. Grint, and Timothy Wright, the Company\u2019s former Chief Research and Development Officer. The Complaint alleges claims similar to those asserted by Mr. Polat. The actions have been related. On February 17, 2017, the District Court entered an order stating that defendants need not answer, or otherwise respond, until the District Court enters an order appointing, pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and the parties then submit a schedule to the District Court for the filing of an amended or consolidated complaint and the timing of defendants\u2019 answer or response. On April 3, 2017, two motions for consolidation of the two actions, appointment of lead plaintiff and approval of counsel were filed in the actions. On October 26, 2017, the District Court entered an order\nconsolidating the cases, appointing lead plaintiffs, and appointing lead counsel for lead plaintiffs. On December 22, 2017, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint against the Company, Dr. Grint, Mr. Hagan, and Michael Huang (our former Vice President of Clinical Development). The consolidated complaint alleges that between February 17, 2016 and June 12, 2017, the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by making materially false and misleading statements regarding RG-101. The consolidated complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On February 6, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. On March 23, 2018, plaintiff filed their opposition to the motion and on April 24, 2018, defendants filed their response. On September 5, 2019, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on October 1, 2019. Subsequent to the filing of the amended complaint, counsel for the parties engaged in negotiations to resolve the case. On November 4, 2019, the parties agreed in principle to settle the case for $0.9 million, with approximately $0.3 million to be paid by us and the balance to be paid by our D&O insurance carrier. On December 11, 2019, the parties entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement, which was amended on February 6, 2020.

{"section": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is subject to certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company\u2019s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates risk is related to our foreign-based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s operations are based in the U.S., and furthermore the functional currencies in our India, Singapore, and Dubai product development centers is the U.S. dollar; accordingly a large portion of our business transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, the Company has operations in Australia, India, New Zealand, Great Britain, Canada, Brazil, Dubai, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, and United Arab Emirates where we conduct transactions in the local currencies of each of these locations. There can be no assurance that fluctuations in the value of those foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results, revenues or financial condition. During the years of 2019 and 2018 the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation account, which is a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, was an unrealized losses of $15.0 million, and $39.4 million, respectively. The Company considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in our respective foreign currency exchange rates of 20% could possibly be experienced in the near term future. Such an adverse change in currency exchange rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $14.8 million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $717.2 million of outstanding debt obligations, excluding amounts related to deferred financing costs, which consisted of a $276.2 million term loan, a $438.0 million balance on our commercial banking revolving line of credit, a $1.8 million note due to IHC by the EbixHealth JV, and $1.2 million of remaining debt pertaining to the Weizmann acquisition. The Company\u2019s revolving line of credit bears interest at the rate of LIBOR + 2.25%, and stood at 4.25% at December 31, 2019. The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to this line of credit and secured term loan in regards to the potential increase to interest expense arising from adverse changes in the LIBOR interest rates. This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 30% increase in the LIBOR rate. Such an adverse change in the LIBOR rate would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $5.7 million and $3.8 million for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company\u2019s average cash balances and short term investments during 2019 were $124.6 million and its existing cash balances as of December 31, 2019 was $73.2 million and short term investments was $4.4 million. The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates. This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 20% decrease in interest rates earned on deposited funds.

{"section": "ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities, and when deemed appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps. It is our policy to enter into interest rate swaps only to the extent considered necessary to meet our risk management objectives. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nVariable Rate Indebtedness\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate indebtedness. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct effect on interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness. As of March 31, 2019, we had $20.0 million in outstanding variable rate indebtedness, after consideration of the interest rate swap. We manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements. At March 31, 2019, we had an interest rate swap agreement that covered 36.4% of the $31.5 million of our total outstanding indebtedness. At March 31, 2019, the unhedged variable rate indebtedness of $20.0 million had a weighted average interest rate of 3.74%. Each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a change of less than $0.1 million in our interest expense on an annual basis.\nWe may also be exposed to credit risk in derivative contracts we may use. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We have sought to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe conduct a small portion of our operations outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our non-U.S. operations are conducted primarily in their local currencies, which are also their functional currencies, and include the British pound, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. Foreign currency exposures arise from translation of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and from transactions denominated in a currency other than a non-U.S. operation\u2019s functional currency. We realized net (losses) gains associated with foreign currency translation of $(2.0) million, $3.3 million and $(2.9) million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017, respectively, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We recognized foreign currency transaction net gains (losses) of $0.4 million, $(0.4) million and $1.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017, respectively, which are included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis at March 31, 2019, a 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended March 31, 2019 would have impacted our income from continuing operations by approximately 1%. This calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion relative to the U.S. dollar and that there are no indirect effects, such as changes in non-U.S. dollar sales volumes or prices.\nITEM 8:", "summary": "Summary: The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL\nWe are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation in general, and securities and intellectual property litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Other than as described below, we are not a party to any other material legal proceedings.\nSecurities Class Actions\nBeginning on February 2, 2001, a number of securities class action complaints were filed against us, certain of our current and former officers and directors and our independent accountants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaints have been filed as purported class actions by individuals who allege that they purchased our common stock during a purported class period; the alleged class periods vary among the complaints and are in the process of being consolidated into a single action. The complaints generally allege that, in differing periods from April 2000 to February 1, 2001, we and other named the defendants made false or misleading statements of material fact about our financial statements, including our revenues, revenue recognition policies, business operations and prospects for the year\n2000 and beyond. The complaints seek an unspecified amount in damages on behalf of persons who purchased Critical Path stock during certain periods.\nDerivative Actions\nBeginning on February 5, 2001, we have been named as a nominal defendant in a number of derivative actions, purportedly brought on our behalf, filed in the Superior Court of the State of California. The derivative complaints allege that certain of our current and former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to us, engaged in abuses of their control of us, were unjustly enriched by their sales of our common stock, engaged in insider trading in violation of California law or published false financial information in violation of California law. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages on our behalf from each of the defendants. Because of the nature of derivative litigation, any recovery in the action would inure to our benefit.\nSEC Investigation\nIn February 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a formal order of investigation of Critical Path and certain unidentified individuals associated with Critical Path with respect to non-specified accounting matters, financial reports, other public disclosures and trading activity in our securities. While we do not know the current status of the investigation or any possible actions that may be taken against us as a result, any SEC action against us could harm our business.\nThe uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits and the SEC investigation could seriously harm our business and financial condition. In particular, the lawsuits or the investigation could harm our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers. The continued defense of the lawsuits and conduct of the investigation could also result in the diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. Negative developments with respect to the lawsuits or the investigation could cause our stock price to decline significantly. In addition, although we are unable to determine the amount, if any, that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of these lawsuits or the investigation by settlement or otherwise, the size of any such payment could seriously harm our financial condition.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "Critical Path is currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, including securities class action lawsuits, derivative actions, and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nFor a discussion of additional risks arising from our operations, see Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" included in this Report.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates (including credit spreads), foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in fuel prices. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and have not been used for speculative or trading purposes. In addition, derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on such instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings assuming various changes in market interest rates. Assuming a hypothetical increase of one percentage point in interest rates on our ABL Credit Facility, AR Facility and cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, our pre-tax earnings would decrease by an estimated $4.0 million over a 12-month period.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk on our mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Consistent with the terms of certain agreements governing our debt obligations, we may decide to hedge a portion of the floating rate interest exposure under the ABL Credit Facility to provide protection in respect of such exposure.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe have foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily with respect to the Canadian dollar.\nWe manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring, to the extent practicable, operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate, including making fleet and equipment purchases and borrowing locally.\nWe also manage exposure to fluctuations in currency risk on cross currency intercompany loans we make to certain of our subsidiaries by entering into foreign currency forward contracts, when appropriate, which are intended to offset the impact of foreign currency movements on the underlying intercompany loan obligations.\nWe do not hedge our operating results against currency movement as they are primarily translational in nature. Using foreign currency forward rates as of December 31, 2020, each hypothetical one percentage point change in foreign currency movements would not have a significant impact on our revenue or earnings.\nHERC HOLDINGS INC.

{"section": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should be particularly aware of the inherent risks associated with our business plan. These risks include but are not limited to:\nGeneral\nThe current worldwide economic situation could have a material adverse impact and proposed government regulations may effect the use of apps.\nWe do not have sufficient revenues to sustain our operations.\nWe have no revenues from operations. All funding is from a third party. As of July 31, 2018, and 2019 respectively, we had cash on hand of $0 and $90. For our fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 and 2019 respectively, we have reported a net loss of $(2,034) and $(14,129) a working capital deficiency of $(208,427) and $(193,160); and a stockholders\u2019 deficit of $(208,427) and $1,167,215 respectively.\nWe expect that we will continue to incur operating losses until our apps have proven themselves in the marketplace. If the apps are not successful, and if sales are not actualized in the near future it will adversely affect the company. Failure to achieve or maintain profitability may materially and adversely affect the future value of our common stock.\nIf we do not obtain additional financing, our business will fail.\nThe Company currently has no operating funds, all funding is from a third party. If funding from shareholders, third parties or financing is not obtained we will not be able to launch the apps, and nor will we be able to complete our business plan. We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and we may not be able to find such financing if required. Market factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unavailable to us.\nOur management has limited experience in development and negotiating commercial arrangements.\nOur Board has limited experience in the development of apps, commercialization and negotiating licenses or arrangements. As a result of this inexperience, there is a risk we may be unable to complete our business plan and successfully commercialize our apps.\nWe have been the subject of a going concern opinion from our independent auditors, which means that we may not be able to continue operations unless we obtain additional funding.\nOur independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinions, issued in connection with our financial statements, which states that our ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain.\nBecause our stock is deemed a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and is therefore subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under this rule, broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). The penny stock rules severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market, and many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions. As a result, there is generally less trading in penny stocks and you may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock publicly at the time and prices that you feel are fair or appropriate. Under applicable regulations, our common stock will generally remain a penny stock until and for such time as its per-share price is $5.00 or more (as determined in accordance with SEC regulations), or until we meet certain net asset or revenue thresholds. These thresholds include the possession of net tangible assets (that is, total assets less intangible assets and liabilities) in excess of $2,000,000, and the recognition of average revenues equal to at least $6,000,000 for each of the last three years. We do not anticipate meeting any of the thresholds in the foreseeable future.\nItem 1B.", "summary": "Risk Factors is a text that outlines the risks associated with a business plan. These risks include the current economic situation, lack of revenue, lack of operating funds, limited experience in development and negotiating commercial arrangements, and the difficulty of selling shares of the company's common stock due to its status as a \"penny stock\". The text also mentions that the company has been the subject of a going concern opinion from its independent auditors, which means that it may not be able to continue operations unless it obtains additional funding."}
{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes, product liability, asbestos, environmental, safety and health, patent infringement and employment matters.\nWhile we believe that a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements could change in the future.\nEnvironmental matters\nWe have been named as defendant, target or a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") in a number of environmental clean-ups relating to our current or former business units. We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future for existing business units, as well as both divested and acquired businesses. In addition to clean-up actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.\nCertain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a site-by-site basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based on current law and existing technologies. It can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors. In our opinion, the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known. As of December 31, 2020, our recorded reserves for environmental matters were not material. We do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, unknown conditions, new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future.\nProduct liability claims\nWe are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims. A substantial number of lawsuits and claims incurred prior to the effective date of the separation on April 30, 2018 are insured and accrued for by the former Parent\u2019s captive insurance subsidiary. Lawsuits and claims incurred after the separation are insured and accrued for by Tonka Bay, a captive insurance subsidiary of nVent. For all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. We have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "nVent has been named as a defendant, target, or potentially responsible party in a number of environmental clean-up actions, and may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future.

{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nRoyalty Matters\nMore than 30 oil companies, including Devon, are involved in disputes in which it is alleged that such companies and related parties underpaid royalty, overriding royalty and working interests owners in connection with the production of crude oil. The proceedings include suits in federal court in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Wyoming that have been consolidated into one proceeding in\nTexas. To avoid expensive and protracted litigation, certain parties, including Devon, have entered into a global settlement agreement which provides for a settlement of all claims of all members of the settlement class. The court held a fairness hearing and issued an Amended Final Judgment approving the settlement on September 10, 1999. However, certain entities have appealed their objections to the settlement.\nAlso, pending in federal court in Texas is a similar suit alleging underpaid royalties to the United States in connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold from United States owned and/or controlled lands. The claims were filed by private litigants against Devon and numerous other producers, under the federal False Claims Act. The United States served notice of its intent to intervene as to certain defendants, but not Devon. Devon and certain other defendants are challenging the constitutionality of whether a claim under the federal False Claims Act can be maintained absent government intervention. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure in association with this litigation. As a result, Devon's monetary exposure in this suit is not expected to be material.\nMaersk Rig Contract\nIn December 1997, the working interest owner partner of Pennzoil Venezuela Corporation, S.A. (\"PVC\"), a subsidiary of Devon as a result of the PennzEnergy merger, entered into a contract with Maersk Jupiter Drilling, S.A. (\"Maersk\") for the provision of a rig for drilling services relative to the anticipated drilling program associated with Devon's Block 70/80 in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela. The rig was assembled and delivered by Maersk to Lake Maracaibo where it performed an abbreviated drilling program for both Blocks 68/79 and 70/80. It is currently stacked in Lake Maracaibo. The contract, which expires October 1, 2001, provides for early termination, with a charge for such termination which is currently estimated at $42,000 per day with certain escalation factors for the balance of the term. As of December 31, 2000, Devon's consolidated balance sheet included accrued liabilities, reflected in \"Other liabilities,\" for the expected cost to terminate/settle the contract. Devon does not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material costs in excess of the liability recognized for such termination/settlement of the contract.\nDevon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devon's knowledge, as of March 12, 2001, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "Devon is involved in several legal proceedings related to alleged underpayment of royalties, including a global settlement agreement and a suit alleging underpayment of royalties to the United States.

Devon is also involved in other routine legal proceedings, but none of them are expected to have a material impact on the company."}
{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. We continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them.\nInterest Rate Risk - Nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2020, approximately 22% of Nucor\u2019s long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. The remaining 78% of Nucor\u2019s long-term debt was at fixed rates. Future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. Nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2020, there were no such contracts outstanding. Nucor\u2019s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments.\nCommodity Price Risk - In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. We attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. In periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. When demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. Our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs. DRI is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic steel production.\nNatural gas produced by Nucor\u2019s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our Louisiana DRI facility and our steel mills in the United States.\nNucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. Gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in net earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. At December 31, 2020, accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes included $4.7 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. Changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. The following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of the derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2020, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands):\nAny resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. These hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities.\nForeign Currency Risk - Nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in Canada, Europe and Mexico. We periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. Open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were insignificant.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks, which it manages through a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, interest rate swaps, and investments in highly liquid securities with short maturities.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. The majority of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates and we expect that our loans in the future may also have floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on a floating LIBOR and typically have interest rate re-set provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a monthly or quarterly basis. The majority of the loans in our current portfolio have interest rate floors which will effectively convert the loans to fixed rate loans in the event interest rates decrease. In addition, our Credit Facility has a floating interest rate provision and other credit facilities into which we may enter in the future may also have floating interest rate provisions.\nThe United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted. The elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate agreements extending beyond 2021 with our portfolio companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, in order to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established, which may have an adverse effect on our overall financial condition or results of operations. Following the replacement of LIBOR, some or all of these agreements may bear interest a lower interest rate, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Moreover, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate certain terms of our credit facilities. If we are unable to do so, amounts drawn under our credit facilities may bear interest at a higher rate, which would increase the cost of our borrowings and, in turn, affect our results of operations.\nAssuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 was to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates:\nAlthough we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowing under the Credit Facility or other borrowings that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.\nWe may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates or interest rate floors.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the potential risks associated with changes in interest rates for the company.

At December 31, 2019, there was an aggregate of approximately $196.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding under these facilities, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements discussed below. Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2019, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.0 million.\nThe table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of December 31, 2019:\n(1)\nAmounts are presented before adjusting for debt issuance costs.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nAll of our interest rate swap agreements qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the related gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the interest rate swap agreements.\nBelow is a summary of our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2019:\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations. Generally, we export from the U.S. certain of the equipment and interior finish items and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries. A majority of the revenues and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country\u2019s local currency. U.S. GAAP requires that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency. If our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary, which could impact future results of operations as reported. Currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments. Based upon our equity ownership in our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019, holding everything else constant, a 10% immediate, simultaneous, unfavorable change in all of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed, would decrease the aggregate net book value of our investments in our international subsidiaries by approximately $46.0 million and would decrease the aggregate net income of our international subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2019 by $5.9 million, respectively.\nWe deemed Argentina to be highly inflationary beginning July 1, 2018. A highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over a three-year period.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur exposure to market risk is primarily related to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable rate debt obligations. We currently use interest rate swaps to offset the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our $70.0 million and $75.0 million variable-rate term loans and a portion of our line of credit. The swap on our $70.0 million term loan has a notional amount of $70.0 million and an average pay rate of 2.16%. The swap on our $75.0 million term loan has a notional amount of $75.0 million and an average pay rate of 2.81%. The swap on our line of credit has a notional amount of $50.0 million and an average pay rate of 2.02%. The aggregate fair value of our interest rate swaps is a liability of $7.6 million, as of December 31, 2019. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The interest rate swaps expose us to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparty under the terms of the agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into a private shelf agreement for the issuance of up to $150.0 million of unsecured senior promissory notes (\"unsecured senior notes\"). Under this agreement, we issued $75.0 million of Series A notes due September 13, 2029, bearing interest at a rate of 3.84% annually, and $50.0 million of Series B notes due September 30, 2028, bearing interest at a rate of 3.69% annually. The proceeds from this facility were used to repay outstanding amounts under our unsecured credit facility, retire mortgage debt, and partially fund our acquisition of Lugano at Cherry Creek. As a result of entering into this facility, we have been able to lengthen our average debt maturity duration and lower our weighted average interest rate of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no variable-rate mortgage debt outstanding and $195.1 million of variable-rate borrowings under our line of credit and term loans, of which $195.0 million is fixed through interest rate swaps.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund the acquisition, expansion and refinancing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our profitability and the value of our real estate investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We may manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level or we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, floors, and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations. When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for the payment of distributions to our stockholders and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments.\nThe table below summarizes the outstanding principal balance, weighted-average interest rates and fair value for our notes payable; and the notional amounts, average pay and receive rates of our derivative instruments, based on maturity dates as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n_____________________\n(1) The average pay rate is based on the interest rate swap fixed rate.\n(2) The average receive rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2019.\n(3) The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2019 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate swaps), if applicable, using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2019, where applicable.\nWe expect to borrow funds and make investments at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect future earnings or cash flows on fixed rate debt unless such debt mature or is otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of fixed rate instruments. At December 31, 2019, we did not have any fixed rate debt outstanding.\nConversely, movements in interest rates on variable rate debt would change future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of the debt. However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of variable rate instruments. At December 31, 2019, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $39.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding, after giving consideration to the impact of interest rate swap agreements on approximately $78.5 million of our variable debt. Based on interest rates as of December 31, 2019, if interest rates were 100 basis points higher or lower during the 12 months ending December 31, 2020, interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase or decrease by $0.4 million.\nThe weighted average interest rate of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2019 was 4.1%.

However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including U.S. fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. Interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt, which bears interest at variable rates. Our debt has floating interest rates. We are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates for its floating rate debt. Our floating rate debt requires payments based on variable interest rates such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, eurocurrency rate, and LIBOR. Therefore, increases in interest rates may reduce our net income or loss by increasing the cost of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, we had term loan borrowings of $204.2 million and $90.7 million, respectively, and revolver borrowings of $10.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, outstanding under the respective credit agreements. The borrowings accrue interest at either base rate, described above under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Indebtedness,\u201d plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.50% or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.50% to 3.50% under the New Credit Agreement or a base rate plus a margin of 2.00% to 3.00% or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 3.00% to 4.00%, under the Prior Credit Agreement, in each case depending on the total net leverage ratio, as defined in the respective agreements governing the New Credit Agreement and Prior Credit Agreement.\nWe have entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $140.0 million, that reduces a portion of our exposure to market interest rate risk on certain of our variable-rate debt as discussed in Item II, Part 8, Note 11, \u201cDerivatives.\" A 1.0% increase or decrease in the interest rate applicable to such borrowings under the New Credit Agreement would have increased or decreased cash interest expense on our indebtedness by approximately $0.8 million per annum and $0.8 million per annum, for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively.\nWe may incur additional borrowings from time to time for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out LIBOR rates by the end of 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of any changes in the methods by which the LIBOR is determined, or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Such developments may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past, including sudden or prolonged increases or decreases in LIBOR, or cease to exist, resulting in the application of a successor base rate under the New Credit Agreement, which in turn could have unpredictable effects on our interest payment obligations under the New Credit Agreement.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nInvoices for our services are denominated in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars. We do not expect our future operating results to be significantly affected by foreign currency transaction risk.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt, which bears interest at variable rates.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market-Risk\nOur exposure to market risk relates primarily to our variable-rate indebtedness not subject to interest rate swaps and our fixed-rate debt. Our consolidated aggregate principal variable-rate indebtedness was $129.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, which represented 9.5% and 9.8%, respectively, of our aggregate principal consolidated indebtedness. During 2020 and 2019, our variable-rate indebtedness had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.4% and 3.8%, respectively. Had the weighted-average interest rate been 100 basis points higher, our interest expense for 2020 and 2019 would have increased by $1.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our aggregate principal consolidated fixed-rate debt was $1.2 billion, which represented 90.5% and 90.2%, respectively, of our aggregate principal indebtedness.\nFor certain of our financial instruments, fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties. Accordingly, we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques, such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. However, the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise. Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. The following fair value was determined using the interest rates that we believe our outstanding fixed-rate debt would warrant as of December 31, 2020 and is indicative of the interest rate environment as of December 31, 2020, and does not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations. Accordingly, we estimate that the fair value of our fixed-rate debt was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nOur interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates through the use of fixed-rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. We have historically entered into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable-rate debt.

{"section": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\n(a) Price of Gold\nThe daily spot price of gold has a modest effect on gross revenue if it's between $1,000 and $1,300 an ounce. A significant drop below $1,000 may have an adverse effect on the Company's operation. Closing spot price on December 31 2019 was $1,520. The Company's realized gold values usually exceed the bullion price due to the jewelry and specimen markets which are not affected by the spot price of gold.\n(b) Lack of Proven Reserves\nBecause proven reserves are not utilized as a component for evaluating future earnings or ore values, a sense of uncertainty of existence is perceived by some. Caution is recommended in using the doctrines of reserves as an economic tool for valuing the Sixteen to One mine. While (i) the Company has recovered over one million ounces of gold and (ii) management knows that substantial additional virgin veins exists in the Sixteen to One mine, the Company has no ability to measure potential gold production using the mathematical tools generally recognized in the mining industry; however, the company can prove that approximately seventy percent (70%) of its vein systems have not been developed.\n(c) Governmental Regulation\nThe attached financial statements have not been audited by a Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) accounting firm. Therefore, the Company is not in full compliance with this SEC regulation for companies listed on an exchange. Mining is generally subjected to regulation. State and federal statutes regulate environmental quality, safety, exploration procedures, reclamation, employee?s health and safety, use of explosives, air quality standards, pollution of stream and fresh water sources, noxious odors, noise, dust, and other environmental protection controls as well as the rights of adjoining property owners. Laws may change preventing or delaying the commencement or continuance of given operations.\nThe Company is substantially in compliance with all known safety and environmental standards and regulations, however; it faces reoccurring unreasonable and unlawful demands from the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWCB) or its staff. The Company is forced to expend working capital and time defending excessive and punitive behavior. There can be no assurance that future changes in the laws, regulations or reckless interpretations will not have a material adverse effect. During 2018, CVRWCB staff was invited and accepted invitations to visit the mine property. Ongoing discussions during 2019 have improved the requirements of our 5-year discharge permit.\n(d) Liquidity\nGold inventory at December 31, 2019, was $305,691 primarily as specimens or gold held as jewelry. While history of actual cash sales supports an inventory value exceeding the spot price, no such increases are used to compute the inventory. All inventory of raw material is recorded at spot price per troy ounce. In addition, contract manufacturing costs of jewelry are included in the finished jewelry inventory. Periodic shortfalls in liquidity occur which are not likely to be bridged by institutional debt financing. Management addresses these issues as they arise.\n(e) Price of Stock\nBids and offers are publicly recorded on the stock page of the Company's web site. Exposure is limited. The price of stock may not accurately reflect its fair market value because of the limited marketplace and the existence of a wild and free Gray Market. The company maintains no program to support or promote its stock and is unlikely to conduct a program until a public marketplace is secured.\nThere are conflicting bids, offers and trades between the Company's website and the unregulated Pink Sheet Gray Market, ticker symbol OSTO.

Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases, respectively, in the fair values of those instruments. Additionally, the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. At December 31, 2020, we have available for sale marketable debt securities in the amount of $189,835,000. The fixed income portfolio is comprised of investments with primarily short-term and intermediate-term maturities. The portfolio composition allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates. The fixed income portfolio allows our insurance company subsidiaries to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet obligations.\nOur cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months when purchased. As a result of the short-term nature of our cash instruments, a hypothetical 1% change in interest rates would have minimal impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments.\nWe do not currently use any derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure. We have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of such instruments in the future would be subject to approvals by the Investment Committee of the Board.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is managed by diversifying the fixed income portfolio to avoid concentrations in any single industry group or issuer and by limiting investments in securities with lower credit ratings. Corporate debt securities and asset-backed securities comprise approximately 72% of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio. At December 31, 2020, the credit quality ratings for our fixed income portfolio consisted of the following investment and non-investment grades (as a percent of fair value): 31% AAA rated, 13% AA rated, 35% A rated, 20% BBB rated, and 1% BB rated.\nEquity Price and Concentration Risk\nOur marketable equity securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices. Thus, there is exposure to equity price risk, which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of our marketable equity securities is approximately $133,270,000. Of the $133.3 million marketable equity securities portfolio, our investment in NHI comprises approximately $112.8 million, or 85%, of the total fair value. We manage our exposure to NHI by closely monitoring the financial condition, performance, and outlook of the company. Hypothetically, a 10% change in quoted market prices would result in a related increase or decrease in the fair value of our equity investments of approximately $13.3 million. At December 31, 2020, our marketable equity securities had unrealized gains of $98.3 million. Of the $98.3 million unrealized gains, $88.1 million is related to NHI.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to market risk primarily through its fixed-income and equity portfolios.

{"section": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our senior secured credit facilities. As of September 28, 2019, our senior secured credit facilities are comprised of (i) $7.5 billion term loans and (ii) a $850 million revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding. Borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus LIBOR. The applicable margin for LIBOR rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.50%, and the margin for the term loans range from 2.00% to 2.50% per annum. As of September 28, 2019, the LIBOR rate of approximately 2.00% was applicable to the term loans. A 0.25% change in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by $11 million on variable rate term loans.\nWe seek to minimize interest rate volatility risk through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. As of September 29, 2019, the Company effectively had (i) a $450 million interest rate swap transaction that swaps a one-month variable LIBOR contract for a fixed annual rate of 2.000%, with an effective date in May 2017 and expiration in May 2022, (ii) a $1 billion interest rate swap transaction that swaps a one-month variable LIBOR contract for a fixed annual rate of 2.808% with an effective date in June 2018 and expiration in September 2021, (iii) a $400 million interest rate swap transaction that swaps a one-month variable LIBOR contract for a fixed annual rate of 2.533% with an effective date in February 2019 and expiration in July 2023, (iv) a $884 million interest rate swap transaction that swaps a one month variable LIBOR contract plus 250 basis point spread for a fixed annual rate of 4.357%, with an effective date in July 2019 and expiration in June 2024, and (v) a $473 million interest rate swap transaction that swaps a one month variable LIBOR contract plus 250 basis point spread for a fixed annual rate of 4.550%, with an effective date in July 2019 and expiration in June 2024.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound sterling, Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. Currency translation gains and losses are primarily related to non-U.S. subsidiaries with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars whereby assets and liabilities are translated from the respective functional currency into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates and impact our Comprehensive income. A 10% decline in foreign currency exchange rates would have had a negative $16 million impact on fiscal 2019 Net income.\nThe Company is party to certain cross-currency swaps to hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk. The swap agreements mature May 2022 (\u20ac250 million) and June 2024 (\u20ac1,625 million and \u00a3700 million). In addition to the cross-currency swaps, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign currency denominated long-term debt as net investment hedges of certain foreign operations. As of September 28, 2019, we had outstanding long-term debt of \u20ac1,075 million that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro-denominated foreign subsidiaries. In the future, we may attempt to manage our foreign currency risk on our anticipated cash movements by entering into foreign currency forward contracts to offset potential foreign exchange gains or losses.\nItem 8.", "summary": "QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK: The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect our results of operations and financial condition. We originate finance receivables at either prevailing market rates or at statutory limits. Our finance receivables are structured on a fixed-rate, fixed-term basis. Accordingly, subject to statutory limits, our ability to react to changes in prevailing market rates is dependent upon the speed at which our customers pay off or renew loans in our existing loan portfolio, which allows us to originate new loans at prevailing market rates. Our loan portfolio turns over approximately 1.2 times per year from payments, renewals, and net credit losses. Because our large loans have longer maturities than our small loans and typically renew at a slower rate than our small loans, the rate of turnover of the loan portfolio may change as our large loans change as a percentage of our portfolio.\nWe also are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of certain borrowing activities. As of December 31, 2019, the interest rates on 50.8% of our long-term debt (the securitizations) were fixed. We maintain liquidity and fund our business operations in part through variable-rate borrowings under a senior revolving credit facility and a revolving warehouse credit facility. At December 31, 2019, the balances of the senior revolving credit facility and the revolving warehouse credit facility were $350.8 million and $46.6 million, respectively.\nBorrowings under the senior revolving credit facility bear interest, payable monthly, at rates equal to one-month LIBOR, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, plus a margin of 3.00%, increasing to 3.25% when the availability percentage is below 10%. Borrowings under the revolving warehouse credit facility bear interest, payable monthly, at a blended rate equal to three-month LIBOR, plus a margin of 2.15% (2.20% prior to the October 2019 amendment). As of December 31, 2019, the LIBOR rates under the senior revolving credit facility and the revolving warehouse credit facility were 1.76% and 1.91%, respectively.\nWe have purchased interest rate caps to manage the risk associated with an aggregate notional $350.0 million of our LIBOR-based borrowings. These interest rate caps are based on the one-month LIBOR and reimburse us for the difference when the one-month LIBOR exceeds the strike rate. The interest rate caps have maturities of April 2020 ($100.0 million, 3.25% strike rate), June 2020 ($50.0 million, 2.50% strike rate), and April 2021 ($200.0 million, 3.50% strike rate). See Note 20, \u201cSubsequent Events,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information regarding the purchase of an interest rate cap contract in March 2020.\nEffective interest rates for borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility and the revolving warehouse credit facility were 5.80% and 5.99%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, including, in each case, an unused line fee. Based on the LIBOR rates and the outstanding balances at December 31, 2019, an increase of 100 basis points in LIBOR rates would result in approximately $4.0 million of increased interest expense on an annual basis, in the aggregate, under these LIBOR-based borrowings. Our interest rate cap coverage at December 31, 2019 would reduce this increased expense by approximately $0.1 million on an annual basis.\nThe nature and amount of our debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors.\nRegional Management Corp. | 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 67\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nRegional Management Corp. is exposed to interest rate risk due to the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect their results of operations and financial condition.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments.\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our marketable securities portfolio. Our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements, while earning a reasonable market return. We invest in a variety of U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper. The market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise. Marketable securities as of March 31, 2019 consisted of $392.4 million. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of March 31, 2019, we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial. Our marketable securities are recorded at fair value, and gains or losses from these securities are recognized as they occur. Any such declines would only result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell the investments before their respective scheduled maturities, which we currently do not anticipate.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe have foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and particularly with respect to the Euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Australian dollar. Therefore, our investment in our subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders\u2019 equity. If foreign exchange rates for our international subsidiaries were to have depreciated immediately and uniformly by 10% relative to the U.S. dollar from levels as of March 31, 2019, the result would have been a reduction of stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $17.6 million.\nCredit Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we provide credit to our customers in the health care industry, perform credit evaluations of these customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses, which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses. In fiscal 2019, we had no customers that represented 10% or more of our total revenue or accounts receivable.\nOther Investment Risk\nWe are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the underlying financial condition and credit capacity of certain of our other investments. We periodically make investments in medical device companies that focus on heart failure and heart pump technologies. We monitor any events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant effect on the fair value of our other investments, either due to impairment or based on observable price changes, and make any necessary adjustments. Should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or credit capacity, or fail to meet certain development milestones, a decline in the investments' values may occur, resulting in unrealized or realized losses. In fiscal 2019, we invested $25.0 million in medical device company Shockwave Medical. The fair value of this investment as of March 31, 2019 was $56.2 million and we recognized a gain of $31.2 million in Other income. The aggregate carrying amount of our other investments was $80.8 million and $12.6 million at March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is classified within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as fluctuations in world financial markets, changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.

The investigation relates to the Company providing software like PC Healthcheck to third parties for their use prior to December 31, 2016, when the Company was under management of the previous Board and executive team. Since issuing the CID, the FTC has sought additional written and testimonial evidence from the Company. We have cooperated fully with the FTC\u2019s investigation and provided all requested information. In addition, the Company has not used PC Healthcheck nor provided it to any customers since December 2016.\nOn March 9, 2018, the FTC notified the Company that the FTC was willing to engage in settlement discussions. On November 6, 2018, the Company and the FTC entered into a proposed Stipulation to Entry of Order for Permanent Injunction and Monetary Judgment, or the Consent Order. The Consent Order was approved by the Commission on March 26, 2019 and entered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on March 29, 2019. Entry of the Consent Order by the Court has finally resolved the FTC\u2019s multi-year investigation of this matter.\nPursuant to the Consent Order, under which the Company neither admitted nor denied the FTC\u2019s allegations (except as to the Court having jurisdiction over the matter), the FTC has agreed to accept a payment of $10 million in settlement of the $35 million judgement, subject to the factual accuracy of the information the Company has provided as part of our financial representations. The $10 million payment was made on April 1, 2019 and has been recognized in operating expenses within the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Consent Order, the Company has agreed to implement certain new procedures and enhance certain existing procedures. For example, the Consent Order necessitates that the Company cooperate with representatives of the Commission on associated investigations if needed; imposes requirements on the Company regarding obtaining acknowledgements of the Consent Order and compliance certification, including record creation and maintenance; and prohibits the Company from making misrepresentations and misleading claims or providing the means for others to make such claims regarding, among other things, detection of security or performance issues on consumer\u2019s Electronic Devices. Electronic Devices include, but are not limited to, cell phones, tablets and computers. The Company intends to monitor the impact of the Consent Order regularly and, while the Company currently does not expect the settlement to have a long-term and materially adverse impact on its business, the Company\u2019s business may be negatively impacted as the Company adjusts to some of the changes. If the Company is unable to comply with the Consent Order, then this could result in a material and adverse impact to the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nOther Proceedings\nThe Company has received and may in the future receive additional requests for information, including subpoenas, from other governmental agencies relating to the subject matter of the Consent Order and the Civil Investigative Demand described above.

{"section": "Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\n($ in Millions)\nMarket risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Old Republic's primary market risks consist of interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities and equity price risk associated with investments in equity securities. The Company has no material foreign exchange or commodity risk.\nThe Company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging, enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio, or reducing the cost of its debt obligations. With regard to its equity portfolio, the Company does not own any options nor does it engage in any type of option writing. Traditional investment management tools and techniques are employed to address the yield and valuation exposures of the invested assets base. The long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market. Credit risk is addressed through asset diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities. Reinvestment rate risk is reduced by concentrating on non-callable issues, and by taking asset-liability matching considerations into account. Purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities, which have variable principal prepayment options, are generally avoided. Market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity. The combination of these investment management practices is expected to produce a more stable long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration.\nThe fair value of the Company's long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive, however, to fluctuations in the level of interest rates, but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments. The impact of interest rate movements on the long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net unrealized gains or losses. As a general rule, rising interest rates enhance currently available yields but typically lead to a reduction in the fair value of existing fixed maturity investments. By contrast, a decline in such rates reduces currently available yields but usually serves to increase the fair value of the existing fixed maturity investment portfolio. All such changes in fair value of available for sale securities are reflected, net of deferred income taxes, directly in the shareholders' equity account, and as a separate component of the statement of comprehensive income. Fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost, and therefore, fluctuations in unrealized gains and losses do not impact shareholders' equity. Given the Company's inability to forecast or control the movement of interest rates, Old Republic sets the maturity spectrum of its fixed maturity securities portfolio within parameters of estimated liability payouts, and focuses the overall portfolio on high quality investments. By so doing, Old Republic believes it is reasonably assured of its ability to hold securities to maturity as it may deem necessary in changing environments, and of ultimately recovering their aggregate cost.\nThe following table illustrates the hypothetical effect on the fixed income and equity investment portfolios resulting from movements in interest rates and fluctuations in the equity securities markets, using the S&P 500 index as a proxy, at December 31, 2019:\nItem 8", "summary": "A provides a summary of Old Republic's primary market risks, which consist of interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities and equity price risk associated with investments in equity securities.

We have invested our available cash in short-term, highly liquid financial instruments, having initial maturities of three months or less. When necessary, we have borrowed to fund acquisitions.\nInterest rate risk\nWe derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients. The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate. For 2019, there were average daily cash balances of approximately $2.3 billion maintained in such accounts. We estimate that a 1% change in interest rates would equate to approximately $9.0 million of net income on an annual basis. The effect of changes in interest rates attributable to earnings derived from cash balances we hold for clients is partially offset by changes in interest rates on our variable debt.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total debt of $7,224.3 million, including $5,198.7 million of variable interest rate debt. As of December 31, 2019, a 1% change in LIBOR would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $52.0 million per year.\nEquity price risk\nWe have exposure to equity price risk as a result of our investments in equity securities. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes. The fair value of our investments that are subject to equity price risk as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $93.9 million. The impact of a 10% change in fair value of these investments would have been approximately $6.9 million to net income. Changes in equity values of our investments could have a material effect on our results of operations and our financial position.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nDuring 2019, approximately 27% of our revenues were from clients located outside the United States. A portion of the revenues from clients located outside the U.S. is denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound. While revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies, some subsidiaries do enter into certain transactions in currencies that are different from their local currency. These transactions consist primarily of cross-currency intercompany balances and trade receivables and payables. As a result of these transactions, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which we report in other income (expense). These outstanding amounts were not material for the year ended December 31, 2019. The amount of these balances can fluctuate in the future as we bill customers and buy products or services in currencies other than our functional currency, which could increase our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. We continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange rates as a result of our acquisitions and changes in our operations. We do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes.\nThe foregoing risk management discussion and the effect thereof are forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in global financial markets. The analytical methods used by us to assess and minimize risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text is a summary of Item 7A of a financial disclosure document.

Two purported stockholder class action complaints concerning the Cottage Tender Offer and the Schedule 14D-9 were filed by putative stockholders against the Company and the directors of the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, but have not yet been served. In both complaints, the plaintiffs allege that the Company\u2019s Schedule 14D-9 omits certain information, including, among other things, certain financial data and certain analyses underlying the opinion of Centerview Partners LLC. Plaintiffs assert claims under the federal securities laws and seek, among other things, injunctive and/or monetary relief.\nA third consolidated purported stockholder class action and derivative complaint concerning the Cottage Tender Offer and the Schedule 14D-9 is pending against the directors of the Company, JAB Holding Company, S.\u00e0.r.l., JAB Cosmetics B.V., and Cottage Holdco B.V. in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The Company was named as a nominal defendant.

{"section": "ITEM 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nHsu vs. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et. al.\nOn June 3, 2015, Hsingching Hsu, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a class action lawsuit against us and certain of our executive officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (Case No. 8:15-cv-00865-AG-JCG). On October 16, 2015, lead plaintiff Norfolk Pension Fund filed a consolidated complaint on behalf of all persons who purchased our securities between July 22, 2014 and May 29, 2015. A trial on the claims relating to four statements alleged to have been false or misleading was held from January 15 to January 29, 2019. At trial, the jury found that three of the four challenged statements were not false or misleading, and thus found in the defendants\u2019 favor on those claims. The jury found liability as to one statement and awarded a maximum of $4.50 per share in damages, which represents approximately 5% of the total claimed damages of $87.20 per share. Trading models suggest that approximately ten million shares traded during the class period may be eligible to claim damages. Based on prior lawsuits, we believe that the number of stockholders who submit proof of claims sufficient to recover damages is typically in the range of 20% to 40% of the total eligible shares. Based on these assumptions, total damages after claims could range from $9 million to $18 million. The total amount of aggregate class-wide damages remains uncertain and will be ascertained only after an extensive claims process and the exhaustion of any appeals, and it is reasonably possible that the total damages will be higher than this estimate. However, the amount is not estimable at this time.\nOn September 9, 2019, the Court entered an order specifying the rate of prejudgment interest to be awarded on any valid claims at the 52-week Treasury Bill rate. The Court\u2019s order also established a claims process, which is expected to take about twelve months. A final judgment has not been entered.\nEshelman vs. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et. al.\nIn February 2016, Fredric N. Eshelman filed a lawsuit against our Chief Executive Officer and President, Alan H. Auerbach, and us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina (Case No. 7:16-cv-00018-D). The complaint generally alleged that we and Mr. Auerbach made defamatory statements regarding Dr. Eshelman in connection with a proxy contest. In May 2016, Dr. Eshelman filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the claims against Mr. Auerbach. A trial on the remaining defamation claims against us took place from March 11 to March 15, 2019. At trial, the jury found us liable and awarded Dr. Eshelman $15.9 million in compensatory damages and $6.5 million in punitive damages. The plaintiff has since filed motions seeking attorneys\u2019 fees and pre-judgment interest, which if granted could increase the judgment amount. We strongly disagree with the verdict and, on April 22, 2019, filed a motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, a reduced damages award. If the verdict is upheld, pending the outcome of that motion, we intend to appeal the verdict. We estimate the high end of potential damages in the matter could be approximately $26.3 million; however, the actual amount of damages payable by us is still uncertain and will be ascertained only after completion of post-trial proceedings and the exhaustion of any appeals, and such amount could be greater than the amount of expense already recognized or the high end of the estimate.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "Hsu vs. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et. al. and Eshelman vs. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et. al. are two class action lawsuits filed against Puma Biotechnology, Inc. and certain of its executive officers.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK:\nThe principal market risk (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the Company is exposed is foreign exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the Polish zloty currency exchange rate. The Company's long term debt is primarily subject to a fixed rate, and therefore variations in the interest rate do not have a material impact on net interest expense.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKET RISKS.\nOperating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rate movements typically affect economic growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, can cause the Company to adjust its financing and operating strategies. The discussion of changes in currency exchange rates below does not incorporate these other important economic factors.\nInternational operations constitute 100% of the Company's 2000 consolidated operating loss. Some of the Company's operating expenses and capital expenditures are expected to continue to be\ndenominated in or indexed in U.S. dollars. By contrast, substantially all of the Company's revenues are denominated in zloty. Therefore, any devaluation of the zloty against the U.S. dollar that the Company is unable to offset through price adjustments will require it to use a larger portion of its revenue to service its U.S. dollar denominated obligations and contractual commitments.\nThe Company estimates that a further 10% change in foreign exchange rates would impact operating loss by approximately $12.5 million. In other terms a 10% depreciation of the Polish zloty against the U.S. dollar, would result in a $12.5 million decrease in the reported operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because, as discussed in the first paragraph of this section, it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or the Company's financing or operating strategies.\nThe Company does not generally hedge currency translation risk. While the Company may consider entering into transactions to hedge the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain hedging arrangements on commercially satisfactory terms. Therefore, shifts in currency exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results and on its ability to meet its U.S. dollar denominated debt obligations and contractual commitments.\nPoland has historically experienced high levels of inflation and significant fluctuations in the exchange rate for the zloty. The Polish government has adopted policies that slowed the annual rate of inflation from approximately 250% in 1990 to approximately 11.8% in 1998, approximately 7.3% in 1999 and 10.1% in 2000. The exchange rate for the zloty has stabilized and the rate of devaluation of the zloty has generally decreased since 1991. The zloty depreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 1999. However for the year ended December 31, 2000, the zloty appreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 0.12%. Inflation and currency exchange fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the Polish zloty currency exchange rate.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk, including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as described below. The primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term \u201cmarket risk\u201d refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses.\nCommodity Price Risk\nOur major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to the oil and natural gas production of our operators. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production. Pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable, particularly during the past year, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices that our operators receive for production depend on many factors outside of our or their control.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to risk resulting from the concentration of royalty interest revenues in producing oil and natural gas properties and receivables with several significant purchasers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, three purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of royalty interest revenue: Trafigura Trading LLC (27%), Concho Resources, Inc. (16%) and Shell Trading (US) Company, or Shell Trading (12%). For the year ended December 31, 2018, three purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of royalty interest revenue: Shell Trading (31%), Concho Resources, Inc. (16%) and Trafigura Trading LLC (11%). For the year ended December 31, 2017, two purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of royalty interest revenue: Shell Trading (47%) and RSP Permian LLC (23%). We do not require collateral and do not believe the loss of any single purchaser would materially impact our operating results, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers.\nIf we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to oil and natural gas production from our properties, we will expose ourselves to credit risk, which is the failure of the courterparty to perform under the terms of the arrangement.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our credit agreement. The terms of our credit agreement provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50% and 3-month LIBOR plus 1.0%) or LIBOR, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.75% to 1.75% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.75% to 2.75% per annum in the case of LIBOR, in each case depending on the amount of the loans outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. We entered into this credit agreement on July 8, 2014, as subsequently amended and restated, and as of December 31, 2019, we had $96.5 million in outstanding borrowings. Our weighted average interest rate was 4.3%. An increase or decrease of 1% in the interest rate would have a corresponding increase or decrease in our interest expense of approximately $1.0 million based on the $96.5 million outstanding in the aggregate under our credit agreement on December 31, 2019.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "A. is a disclosure of market risk exposure, including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS -----------------\nIn March 1998, we sued Lexar in the Northern District of California alleging that Lexar's CompactFlash and PC Cards infringe our U.S. Patent No. 5,602,987 (\"'987 Patent\"). Lexar disputed this claim and asserted various counter claims, including unfair competition, violation of the Lanham Act, patent misuse, interference with prospective economic advantage, trade defamation, unenforceability and fraud. On November 14, 2000, in resolution of these actions, Lexar stipulated that SanDisk's '987 Patent is valid and infringed by Lexar's current CompactFlash and PC Cards. Lexar made a lump sum payment of $8.0 million in December 2000 for royalties due on the '987 Patent, through March 31, 2001. Subject to Lexar's representations and warranties relating to Lexar's newly designed CompactFlash and PC Cards, SanDisk has stipulated that these designs do not infringe SanDisk's '987 Patent. Lexar entered into a 4% royalty-bearing license agreement for certain Lexar products that may use the '987 Patent beyond March 31, 2001. SanDisk and Lexar have agreed to dismiss with prejudice all pending claims of patent infringement and counterclaims involving claims of false advertising, unfair competition and patent misuse.\nIn September 2000, Lexar sued SanDisk in the District of Delaware alleging that our SmartMedia products infringe Lexar's United States Patent No. 5,479,638 (\"'638 Patent\"). In resolution of this action, we paid Lexar a lump sum payment of $2.0 million for a fully-paid up license for use of the '638 Patent in SmartMedia products. Under the settlement, Lexar has provided us with an option for a royalty bearing license to its patents for use in certain future products.\nSanDisk and Lexar have agreed to resolve any future disputes relating to the use by Lexar of the '987 Patent through binding arbitration. We have also agreed that for a period of seven years, neither SanDisk nor Lexar shall seek injunctive relief against the other in any patent lawsuit. However, at all times, we retain the right to seek injunctive relief to enforce the payment of royalties pursuant to an arbitrator's ruling.\nOn March 21, 2000, Mitsubishi Denki Co. Ltd. (Mitsubishi Electric) filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court against SanDisk K.K., SanDisk's wholly owned subsidiary. The complaint alleges that SanDisk K.K., based in Yokohama, Japan, infringes on three Mitsubishi Japanese patents. The Mitsubishi patents in question are #JP2099342, #JP2129071 and #JP2138047, which are related primarily to the mechanical construction of memory cards. In the complaint, Mitsubishi asked the court for a preliminary injunction halting the sale of SanDisk CompactFlash and flash ATA memory cards in Japan. Mitsubishi has since dropped patents #JP2129071 and #JP2138047 from the suit. SanDisk and SanDisk K.K. are vigorously defending against Mitsubishi's remaining claims.\nCompaq Corporation has opposed in several countries, including the United States, our attempting to register CompactFlash as a trademark. We do not believe that our failure to obtain registration for the CompactFlash mark will materially harm our business.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nSanDisk and Lexar have resolved their legal disputes regarding patent infringement and counterclaims.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company's primary market risk is interest rate risk (\u201cIRR\u201d). To minimize the volatility of net interest income at risk (\u201cNII\u201d) and the impact on economic value of equity (\u201cEVE\u201d), the Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by the Board\u2019s Asset Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d). ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset/liability management policies, including IRR exposure.\nTo mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on the Company\u2019s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the Company actively manages the amounts and maturities. While the Company has some assets and liabilities in excess of five years, it has internal policy limits designed to minimize risk should interest rates rise. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to help manage risk, but will consider such instruments in the future if the perceived need should arise.\nThe Company uses a simulation model, combined with downloaded detailed information from various application programs, and assumptions regarding interest rates, lending and deposit trends and other key factors to forecast/simulate the effects of both higher and lower interest rates. The results detailed below indicate the impact, in dollars and percentages, on NII and EVE of an increase and decrease in interest rates compared to a flat interest rate scenario. The model assumes that the rate change shock occurs immediately.\nThe following table presents the impact of that analysis in dollars and percentages at December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2019, the following table presents the impact of that analysis in dollars and percentages:\nAs of December 31, 2020 the Fed Funds target rate was a range of 0.00% to 0.25% and the prime rate was 3.25%. As of December 31, 2019, the Fed Funds target rate was a range of 1.75% to 2.00% and the prime rate was 4.75%.\nEconomic Value of Equity. We measure the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of estimated cash flows from our assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items, defined as economic value of equity, using a simulation model. This simulation model assesses the changes in the market value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease (shock) in market interest rates.\nIndex\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our economic value of equity exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us. The following tables show projected change in economic value of equity for this set of rate shocks.\nFor further discussion of interest rate risk, see \u201cItem 7.

The parties began mediation on January 22, 2019, pursuant to court order, and settlement discussions through the mediator are ongoing. The Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss or range of losses, if any, that may arise from this unresolved lawsuit. The Company has incurred approximately $425,000 in legal fees through December 31, 2019 defending this case, including recent preparations for trial. The Company expects to be reimbursed these fees in accordance with the trust agreements and the Kunde organizational documents upon conclusion of this proceeding.\nAt least quarterly, we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. For those matters where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments based on our quarterly reviews. For other matters, where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated, we have not accrued legal reserves, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, we believe that our established reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters, if unfavorable, may be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.\nItem 4.", "summary": "MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nAmerant Bank is engaged in the ordinary course of business in providing banking services and is not engaged in mining activities.\n\nAmerant Bank is not engaged in mining activities and is instead involved in providing banking services in the ordinary course of business.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, consisting of the Credit Facility, the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement, and the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility which permitted borrowings of up to $725 million at December 31, 2019, subject to availability constraints. Additionally, M/I Financial is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services.\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments: Interest rate lock commitments (\u201cIRLCs\u201d) are extended to certain homebuying customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs will have a duration of less than six months; however, in certain markets, the duration could extend to nine months.\nSome IRLCs are committed to a specific third party investor through the use of whole loan delivery commitments matching the exact terms of the IRLC loan. Uncommitted IRLCs are considered derivative instruments and are fair value adjusted, with the resulting gain or loss recorded in current earnings.\nForward Sales of Mortgage-Backed Securities: Forward sales of mortgage-backed securities (\u201cFMBSs\u201d) are used to protect uncommitted IRLC loans against the risk of changes in interest rates between the lock date and the funding date. FMBSs related to uncommitted IRLCs are classified and accounted for as non-designated derivative instruments and are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded in current earnings.\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale: Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property. During the period between when a loan is closed and when it is sold to an investor, the interest rate risk is covered through the use of a whole loan contract or by FMBSs. The FMBSs are classified and accounted for as non-designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses recorded in current earnings.\nThe table below shows the notional amounts of our financial instruments at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nThe table below shows the measurement of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nThe following table sets forth the amount of gain (loss) recognized on assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nThe following table provides the expected future cash flows and current fair values of borrowings under our credit facilities and mortgage loan origination services that are subject to market risk as interest rates fluctuate, as of December 31, 2019. Because the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement and MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility are effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 30 to 45 days, their outstanding balances are included in the most current period presented. The interest rates for our variable rate debt represent the weighted average interest rates in effect at December 31, 2019. For fixed-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flow. Conversely, for variable-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument, but do affect our earnings and cash flow. We do not have the obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity, and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on our fixed-rate debt until we are required or elect to refinance it.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Indian Rupee, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen and Euro. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") held a referendum in which British voters approved an exit from the European Union (\"EU\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" This resulted in an adverse impact to currency exchange rates, notably the British Pound Sterling which experienced a sharp decline in value compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Continued volatility in currency exchange rates is expected as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU, which could result in greater transaction gains or losses in our statement of operations.\nThe effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions.\nAs our international operations continue to grow, our risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion, and a strengthening U.S. dollar could slow international demand as products and services priced in U.S. dollars become more expensive.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents and investments of $1,039.6 million and $1,116.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, consisting of bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and bonds issued by corporate institutions, U.S. Treasury notes and U.S. government agencies. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk, but the risk is limited due to our investment policies which limit the duration of our short term investments. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant.\nWe do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates.\nOur cash flow exposure due to changes in interest rates related to our debt is limited as our Series A Notes, Series B Notes and 2024 Notes have fixed interest rates of 1.000%, 1.625% and 0.875%, respectively. The fair value of the Convertible Notes may increase or decrease for various reasons, including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions. Based upon the quoted market price as of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our Convertible Notes was approximately $1.1 billion.\nA hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A of the company's financial statement discloses the risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations.

The complaints purport to be filed on behalf of holders of America Online or Time Warner stock, as applicable, and allege breaches of fiduciary duty by the applicable company and its directors or aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty by the other company and its directors in connection with the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner. The plaintiffs in each case seek to enjoin completion of the merger and/or damages. These cases are at a preliminary stage, but the Company does not believe these lawsuits have any merit and intends to defend against them vigorously. The Company is unable, however, to predict the outcome of these cases, or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss given the current status of the litigation.\nSince March 2000, America Online has been named as a defendant in several class action lawsuits that have been filed in state and federal courts. The complaints in these lawsuits contend that consumers and competing Internet service providers have been injured because of the default selection features in AOL 5.0. Plaintiffs are seeking damages, an injunction enjoining the distribution of AOL Version 5.0 software, and disgorgement of all monies that the Company has earned through the distribution of its Version 5.0 software.

We do not use derivative financial instruments.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. We currently have wholly-owned subsidiaries with operations in the United Kingdom and Europe. All sales and expenses incurred by the foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the British pound and Euro, which are considered the functional currencies of the respective subsidiaries. As such, we are exposed to foreign currency risk which arises in part from funding denominated in British pounds and Euros provided to the foreign subsidiaries and from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries' financial results into U.S. dollars during consolidation. As exchange rates vary, our results from operations and profitability may be adversely impacted. As of March 31, 2000, the effect of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has not been material.\nINTEREST RATE RISK. We maintain a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents maturing in three months or less as of the date of purchase. Given the short-term nature of these investments, we believe we are not subject to significant interest rate risk with respect to these investments. Additionally, we are subject to interest rate risk related to the $150 million of convertible notes, combined with our notes payable and capital lease obligations. Our notes payable and capital lease obligations bear interest at fixed rates, and their carrying amount approximates fair value based on borrowing rates currently available to us. As such, we believe that market risk arising from our notes payable and capital lease obligations is not material. The convertible notes, issued in December 1999, are unsecured and are subordinated to our existing and future senior debt as defined in the indenture pursuant to which the convertible notes were issued. The principal amount of the convertible notes will be due on December 1, 2004 and will bear interest at an annual rate of 6.25%, payable twice a year, on June 1 and December 1, beginning June 1, 2000, until the principal amount of the convertible notes is fully repaid. The convertible notes may be converted into our common stock at the option of the holder at any time prior to December 1, 2004, unless the convertible notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased by us. The conversion rate, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, is 13.5323 shares of our common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $73.90 per share. As of March 31, 2000, the carrying value of the convertible notes was $150 million. As of March 31, 2000, the fair value of the convertible notes was $58.5 million based upon the closing market price as of that date. The difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the convertible notes as of March 31, 2000 is primarily due to declines in the price of our common stock and the favorable interest rate of the convertible notes as compared to current interest rates.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks faced by the company, which include foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.\nIn addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and, based on known facts, assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWe make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise specifically disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, we have determined that no provision for liability or disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.\nAll legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred.

It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.\nIn connection with our piracy conversion efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate senior indebtedness (the Term B-2 Loan and Revolver).\nIf the borrowing rates under LIBOR were to increase 1% above the current rates as of December 31, 2019, our interest expense on: (i) our Term B-2 Loan would increase $7.6 million on an annual basis, including any increase or decrease in interest expense associated with the use of derivative hedging instruments; and (ii) our Revolver would increase by $2.5 million, assuming our entire Revolver was outstanding as of December 31, 2019. From time to time, we may seek to limit our exposure to interest rate volatility through the use of interest rate hedging instruments.\nAssuming LIBOR remains flat, interest expense in 2020 versus 2019 is expected to be lower as we anticipate reducing our outstanding debt upon which interest is computed. We may seek from time to time to amend our Credit Facility or obtain additional funding, which may result in higher interest rates on our indebtedness and could increase our exposure to variable rate indebtedness.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2019, we entered into the following derivative rate hedging transaction in the notional amount of $560.0 million to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable-rate debt. This rate hedging transaction is tied to the one-month LIBOR interest rate.\nOur credit exposure under hedging agreements similar to the agreements that we have entered into in the past, or similar agreements that we may enter into in the future, is the cost of replacing such agreements in the event of nonperformance by our counterparty. To minimize this risk, we select high credit quality counterparties. We do not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties who we may enter into agreements with in the future, but we could recognize a loss in the event of nonperformance.\nFrom time to time, we may invest all or a portion of our cash in cash equivalents, which are money market instruments consisting of short-term government securities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by government securities. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any investments in money market instruments. As of December 31, 2018, we had investments in money market instruments of approximately $69.4 million, which are reflected on our balance sheet as restricted cash. We deposited proceeds from the sale of a parcel of land in Chicago, Illinois and proceeds from the sale of land and buildings in Los Angeles, California into accounts of a Qualified Intermediary (\"QI\"). We deposited the proceeds into an account of a QI to comply with requirements under Section 1031 of the Code to execute a like-kind exchange. This process allowed us to effectively minimize our tax liability in connection with the gains recognized on these asset sales. The cash proceeds in the accounts of the QI are invested in money market accounts. We do not believe that we have any material credit exposure with respect to these assets.\nOur credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the quantity of advertisers, the minimal reliance on any one advertiser, the multiple markets in which we operate and the wide variety of advertising business sectors.\nSee also additional disclosures regarding liquidity and capital resources made under Part II, Item 7, above.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risk associated with changes in interest rates on variable rate senior indebtedness, such as the Term B-2 Loan and Revolver.

While the allegations contained in each complaint are not identical, the complaints generally assert that the $16.25 per share price to be paid to the minority shareholders is inadequate and does not reflect the value of the assets and future prospects of the Company. The complaints also generally allege that the director defendants engaged in self-dealing without regard to conflicts of interest and that they breached their fiduciary duties in approving the Merger Agreement. The complaints seek remedies including unspecified monetary damages, attorneys' fees and injunctive relief that would, if granted, prevent the completion of the Merger.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to many market risk factors, including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates, as well as changes in the cost of raw materials. These risk factors may affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nWe manage these risks through regular operating and financing methods, including the use of derivative financial instruments. When we have derivative instruments, they are with major financial institutions and are not for speculative or trading purposes. Also, as part of our financial risk management, we regularly review significant contracts for embedded derivatives and, if identified, would record them in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nThe following analysis presents the effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at December 31, 2019. We analyzed only the potential impacts of our hypothetical assumptions. This analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total long-term debt of $643 million. Of the total long-term debt, $600 million is at fixed rates. There was no interest rate risk at the end of the year associated with the fixed rate debt.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $45 million of outstanding variable rate debt under our revolving credit facility. Holding all other variables constant, if the variable portion of the interest rates hypothetically increased 10%, the effect on our earnings and cash flows would not be material.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, holding all other variables constant, would have resulted in a change of $28 million in fair value of our debt at December 31, 2019.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign subsidiaries, as well as through export sales from the United States. These transactions are often denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our primary currency exposures are the European Union Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Singapore Dollar, Mexican Peso, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar. We may enter into forward contracts as hedges to minimize the fluctuation of intercompany accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding forward contracts.\nRaw Material Price Risk\nWe utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products, including base oil, polyisobutylene, antioxidants, alcohols, solvents, sulfonates, friction modifiers, olefins, and copolymers. We may also enter into contracts which commit us to purchase some of our more critical raw materials based on anticipated demand. Our profitability is sensitive to changes in the quantities of raw materials we may need and the costs of those materials which may be caused by changes in supply, demand or other market conditions, over which we have little or no control. In addition, political and economic conditions in certain regions of the world in which we operate have caused, and may continue to cause, our demand for and the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate. War, armed hostilities, terrorist acts, civil unrest, or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp change in our demand for and the cost of our raw materials. If we experience such increases in the cost of our raw materials, we may not be able to pass them along to our customers in the form of price increases for our products. The inability to do so would have a negative impact on our operating profit. In addition, if our demand for raw materials were to decline such that we would not have need for the quantities required to be purchased under commitment agreements, we could incur additional charges that would affect our profitability.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text provides an overview of the market risks that the company is exposed to, including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates, as well as changes in the cost of raw materials.

Assuming no change in our outstanding cash, cash equivalents, and investments during the first quarter of 2021, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates, occurring during and sustained throughout that quarter, would not have a material impact on our financial results for that quarter.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our mortgage loans held for sale and IRLCs associated with our mortgage loan origination services. We manage this interest rate risk through the use of forward sales commitments on both a best effort whole loans basis and on a mandatory basis. Forward sales commitments entered into on a mandatory basis are done through the use of commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities. We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The fair value of our IRLCs and forward sales commitments are reflected in other current assets and accrued liabilities, as applicable, with changes in the fair value of these commitments recognized as revenue. The net fair value change for the periods presented were not material. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of the fair value of our forward sales commitments and our IRLCs.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of this facility. Changes in the market interest rate will increase or decrease our interest expense. Assuming no change in the outstanding borrowings under the facility during the first quarter of 2021, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates, occurring during and sustained throughout that quarter, would not have a material impact on our financial results for that quarter.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nAs our operations in Canada have been limited, and we do not maintain a significant balance of foreign currency, we do not currently face significant foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: The company is exposed to market risks, primarily consisting of fluctuations in interest rates.

As the company's operations in Canada are limited, it does not currently face significant foreign currency exchange rate risk."}
{"section": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to our businesses. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business or finances, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. We accrue for losses from litigation and claims if we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nRiley Ridge Helium Supply Contract Claim\nAs part of our 2010 and 2011 acquisitions of the Riley Ridge Unit and associated gas processing facility that was under construction, the Company assumed a 20-year helium supply contract under which we agreed to supply the helium separated from the full well stream by operation of the gas processing facility to a third-party purchaser, APMTG Helium, LLC (\u201cAPMTG\u201d). The helium supply contract provides for the delivery of a minimum contracted quantity of helium, with liquidated damages payable if specified quantities of helium are not supplied in accordance with the terms of the contract. The liquidated damages are capped at an aggregate of $46.0 million over the term of the contract.\nAs the gas processing facility has been shut-in since mid-2014 due to significant technical issues, we have not been able to supply helium under the helium supply contract. In a case filed in November 2014 in the Ninth Judicial District Court of Sublette County, Wyoming, APMTG claimed multiple years of liquidated damages for non-delivery of volumes of helium specified under the helium supply contract. The Company claimed that its contractual obligations were excused by virtue of events that fall within the force majeure provisions in the helium supply contract.\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nOn March 11, 2019, the trial court entered a final judgment that a force majeure condition did exist, but the Company\u2019s performance was excused by the force majeure provisions of the contract for only a 35-day period in 2014, and as a result the Company should pay APMTG liquidated damages and interest thereon for those time periods from contract commencement to the close of evidence (November 29, 2017). The Company\u2019s position continues to be that its contractual obligations have been and continue to be excused by events that fall within the force majeure provisions of the helium supply contract, so the Company has appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling to the Wyoming Supreme Court. Briefing for the appeal by the Company and APMTG is currently expected to be completed in late May or early June, after which oral arguments will be scheduled and heard prior to the Wyoming Supreme Court entering its judgment on the appeal. The timing and outcome of this appeal process is currently unpredictable, but at this time is anticipated to extend over the next nine to twelve months.\nAbsent reversal of the trial court\u2019s ruling on appeal, the Company anticipates total liquidated damages would equal the $46.0 million aggregate cap under the helium supply contract plus $5.2 million of associated costs (through December 31, 2019), for a total of $51.2 million, which is included in \u201cOther liabilities\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019, and $49.4 million of which was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company currently has a $32.8 million letter of credit posted as security in this case as part of the appeal process.\nItem 4.", "summary": "Denbury Resources Inc. is involved in a lawsuit with APMTG Helium, LLC over a 20-year helium supply contract. The contract includes liquidated damages of up to $46 million if specified quantities of helium are not supplied.

{"section": "Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe primary market risks to which the Company is exposed include changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. The Company manages these risks through derivative instruments and various operating actions including fixed price contracts with suppliers and cost sourcing arrangements with customers. The Company's use of derivative instruments is limited to mitigation of market risks, including hedging activities. However, derivative instruments are not used for speculative or trading purposes, as per clearly defined risk management policies. Additionally, the Company's use of derivative instruments creates exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counter-party to the derivative financial instruments. The Company limits this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a variety of major financial institutions with high credit standards and that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. Additionally, the Company's ability to utilize derivatives to manage market risk is dependent on credit conditions and market conditions given the current economic environment.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Company\u2019s net cash inflows and outflows exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arise from the sale of products in countries other than the manufacturing source, foreign currency denominated supplier payments, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, investments in subsidiaries, and anticipated foreign currency denominated transaction proceeds. Where possible, the Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks. Forward and option contracts may be utilized to reduce the impact to the Company's cash flow from adverse movements in exchange rates. Foreign currency exposures are reviewed periodically and any natural offsets are considered prior to entering into a derivative financial instrument. The Company\u2019s primary hedged foreign currency exposures include the euro and Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Where possible, the Company utilizes a strategy of partial coverage for transactions in these currencies. The Company's policy requires that hedge transactions relate to a specific portion of the exposure not to exceed the aggregate amount of the underlying transaction.\nIn addition to the transactional exposure described above, the Company's operating results are impacted by the translation of its foreign operating income into U.S. dollars. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate this exposure. The hypothetical pretax gain or loss in fair value from a 10% favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately $31 million and $32 million for foreign currency derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These estimated changes assume a parallel shift in all currency exchange rates and include the gain or loss on financial instruments used to hedge investments in subsidiaries. Because exchange rates typically do not all move in the same direction, the estimate may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on the net fair value of the Company's financial derivatives. It is also important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged.\nInterest Rate Risk\nSee Note 18, \"Financial Instruments\" to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8", "summary": "of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's exposure to interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and certain commodity prices.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn connection with our Wells Fargo line of credit, which has a variable interest rate, we are subject to market risk associated with changes in LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019, we had $81,600 outstanding under our Wells Fargo line of credit bearing interest at approximately 3.33%, representing approximately 60.0% a loan-to-cost ratio with respect to the real estate investments encumbered by this line of credit. At this balance, a change in the interest rate of 0.50% would result in a change in our interest expense of $408 per annum. In the future, we may be exposed to additional market risk associated with interest rate changes as a result of additional short-term debt, such as additional borrowings under our line of credit, and long-term debt, which, in either case, may be used to maintain liquidity, fund capital expenditures and expand our investment portfodlio. Market fluctuations in real estate financing may affect the availability and cost of funds needed to expand our investment portfolio. In addition, restrictions upon the availability of real estate financing or high interest rates for real estate loans could adversely affect our ability to dispose of real estate in the future. We will seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. We intend to manage market risk associated with our variable-rate financing by assessing our interest rate cash flow risk, through continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows, and by evaluating hedging opportunities. We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our assets.\nWe will be exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We will seek to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. We are not currently a party to any such derivative contracts.\nWe will be exposed to financial market risk with respect to our marketable securities portfolio. Financial market risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity security prices. Our exposure to changes in equity security prices is a result of our investment in these types of securities. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, therefore, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market prices of a security may result from any number of factors, including perceived changes in the underlying fundamental characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments, interest rates, default rates and general market conditions. In addition, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold. We do not currently engage in derivative or other hedging transactions to manage our security price risk. As of December 31, 2019, we owned $21,245 of marketable securities. While it is difficult to project what factors may affect the prices of equity securities and how much the effect might be, a 10% change in the value of the marketable securities we owned as of December 31, 2019 would result in a change of $2,125 to the unrealized gain on marketable securities.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nWells Fargo & Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in LIBOR, as well as potential fluctuations in real estate financing and equity security prices.

The Company uses the local currency of the Australian dollar in Australia, the Singapore dollar in Singapore and the British Pound in the United Kingdom, as its functional currency in those countries. Translation adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency financial statement into U.S. dollars were $65,400 and $895,700 in the fiscal years ended June 30, 1999 and 2000, respectively. To date, the Company has not experienced material transaction gains or losses due to the limited number of transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary operation. Under current market conditions, the Company believes that its foreign currency market risk is not material. The Company actively monitors its foreign exchange exposure and, should circumstances change, intends to implement strategies to reduce its risk at such time that it determines that the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs. There can be no assurance that management's efforts to reduce foreign exchange exposure will be successful.\nINTEREST RATES\nThe Company's domestic line of credit bears interest based upon the prime rate of a national financial institution plus 1.75% (9.5% as of June 30, 2000).

{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nAppraisal Demand\nOn September 21, 2017, former stockholders of SourceHOV, who owned 10,304 shares of SourceHOV common stock, filed an Appraisal Action. The Appraisal Action arose out of the Novitex Business Combination, and the petitioners sought, among other things, a determination of the fair value of their shares at the time of the Novitex Business Combination; an order that SourceHOV pay that value to the petitioners, together with interest at the statutory rate; and an award of costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and other expenses. During the trial the parties and their experts offered competing valuations of the SourceHOV shares as of the date of the Novitex Business Combination. SourceHOV argued the value was no more than $1,633.85 per share and the petitioners argued the value was at least $5,079.28 per share. On January 30, 2020, the Court issued its post-trial Memorandum Opinion in the Appraisal Action, in which it found that the fair value of SourceHOV as of the Closing Date was $4,591 per share, and on March 26, 2020, the Court issued its final order and judgment awarding the petitioners $57,698,426 inclusive of costs and interest. On May 7, 2020, SourceHOV filed a motion for new trial in relation to share count. Following the Court\u2019s decision on the motion for new trial, SourceHOV has the right to appeal the judgment. At this time, we cannot determine whether such motion or an appeal would be successful. Per the Court\u2019s opinion, the legal rate of interest, compounded quarterly, accrues on the per share value from the Closing Date until the date of payment to petitioners.\nAs a result of the Appraisal Action, 4,570,734 shares of our Common Stock issued to Ex-Sigma 2 have been returned to the Company during the first quarter of 2020.\nClass Action\nOn March 23, 2020. Plaintiff, Bo Shen, filed a putative class action against the Company, Ronald Cogburn, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and James Reynolds, the Company\u2019s former Chief Financial Officer. Plaintiff claims to be a current holder of 4,000 shares of Company stock, purchased on October 4, 2019 at $1.34/share. Plaintiff asserts two claims covering the purported class period of March 16, 2018 to March 16, 2020: (1) a violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act against all defendants; and (2) a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against Mr. Cogburn and Mr. Reynolds. The allegations stem from the Company\u2019s press release, dated March 16, 2020 (announcing the postponement of the earnings call and delay in filing of this Annual Report), and press release and related SEC filings, dated March 17, 2020 (announcing its intent to restate its financial statements for 2017, 2018 and interim periods through September 30, 2019). As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has not been served with the complaint.

{"section": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRG&E is exposed to interest rate and commodity price risks.\nThe interest rate risk relates to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including maturing debt securities, and to variable rate debt. RG&E manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed -rate debt with varying maturities and through economic refundings of debt through optional redemptions. A portion of RG&E's long-term debt consists of long-term Promissory Notes, the interest component of which resets on a periodic basis reflecting current market conditions. See \"Note 6 - Long Term Debt\". RG&E was not participating in any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk as of December 31, 2000 or December 31, 1999.\nThe commodity price risk relates to market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, electricity, and other petroleum-related products used for resale. Commodity purchases and electric generation are based on projected demand for power generation and customer delivery of electricity, natural gas, and petroleum products. RG&E enters into forward contracts for natural gas to hedge the effect of price increases and reduce volatility on gas purchased for resale. Owned electric generation significantly reduces RG&E's exposure to market fluctuations in electric prices. RG&E does not hold open speculative positions in any commodity for trading purposes.\nRG&E's exposure to market price fluctuations of the cost of natural gas is further limited as the result of the Gas Cost Adjustment (GCA), a regulatory mechanism that transfers substantially all gas commodity price risk to the customer. Nonetheless, RG&E does hedge approximately 70% of its gas supply price through the purchase of derivative contracts and the use of storage assets. The balance of RG&E's natural gas requirements is procured through spot market purchases and is subject to market price fluctuations.\nUnder the Electric Settlement, RG&E's electric rates are capped at specified levels through June 30, 2002. As a result of owned generation and long-term fixed rate supply contracts, RG&E is largely insulated from market price fluctuations for procurement of its electric supply. In the event RG&E's generation assets fail to perform as planned, RG&E is exposed to market price fluctuations, and under the current rate agreement, fully absorbs this operating risk.\nEnergetix has entered into electric and natural gas purchase commitments with numerous suppliers. These commitments support fixed price offerings to retail electric and gas customers. Griffith is in the business of purchasing various petroleum-related commodities for resale to its customers. To manage the resulting market price risk, Griffith enters into various exchange-traded futures and option contracts and over-the-counter contracts with third parties. Through December 31, 2000, all hedge contracts have been accounted for under the deferral method with gains and losses from the hedging activity included in the cost of sales as inventories are sold or as the hedge transaction occurs. Commodity instruments not designated as effective hedges are marked to market at the end of the reporting period, with the resulting gains or losses recognized in cost of sales. These contracts are closely monitored on a daily basis to manage the price risk associated with inventory and future sales commitments. At December 31, 2000 and 1999 Griffith's net deferred gains on open hedge contracts were not significant.\nItem 8.", "summary": "RG&E is exposed to market risks related to interest rates and commodity prices. To manage interest rate risk, RG&E issues fixed-rate debt and performs economic refundings. To manage commodity price risk, RG&E enters into forward contracts for natural gas and has owned electric generation. Additionally, the Gas Cost Adjustment transfers most of the gas commodity price risk to customers. Energetix and Griffith manage their market price risk through exchange-traded futures and option contracts and over-the-counter contracts. Gains and losses from these contracts are recognized in cost of sales."}

Our exposure to interest rate sensitivity is impacted by changes in the underlying U.K. and U.S. bank interest rates. Our surplus cash has been invested in corporate bonds, commercial paper, US treasuries, and money market accounts. We have not entered into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio, which is predicated on capital preservation of investments with short-term maturities, we do not believe an immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates.\nWe have borrowed $25.0 million under our credit facility. Amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a variable interest rate of 6% plus LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the term loans under the credit facility was $24.7 million.\nForeign currency exchange risk\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk because it currently operates in the United Kingdom and the United States. The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The Company has determined the functional currency of the ultimate parent company, Orchard Therapeutics plc, is U.S. dollars because it predominantly raises finance and expends cash in U.S. dollars, and expects to continue to do so in the future. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency of the relevant entity at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income (loss) for the respective periods. We recorded a foreign currency gain of $1.5 million $4.4 million and a $1.2 million loss for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other expense (income) in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nAssets and liabilities have been translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet dates, while revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates over the reporting period and shareholders\u2019 equity amounts are translated based on historical exchange rates as of the date of each transaction.

We monitor our foreign currency exposures and from time to time, we enter into currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange exposure, particularly in regard to the Euro positively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2020. This positive impact was mostly offset by the negative impact from the Canadian and Australian dollar for the full year ended December 31, 2020.

You should carefully consider the following information keeping in mind that the matters described below are not the only potential risks that may affect the Company. Additional risks, which we do not presently consider material or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact upon us.\nDuring 2020, a strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID - 19\u201d) was reported, resulting in decreased economic activity and concerns about pandemic, which would adversely affect the broader global economy. At this point, the extent to which COVID - 19 may impact the global economy and our business is uncertain, but pandemics or other significant public health events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur governing documents contain anti-takeover provisions that make it difficult for a third party to seek to acquire control of the Company.\nCertain provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Nevada law could, together or separately, discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, even if doing so might benefit stockholders. The provisions may also affect the price investors might be able to receive for their shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Examples of these provisions are:\n\u2022The right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges, which are senior to the common stock, without prior stockholder approval.\n\u2022Certain limitations upon the stockholders to make, adopt, alter, amend, change, or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation except by a vote of 66 2/3% of the holders of record of shares outstanding.\n\u2022So-called business combination \u201ccontrol\u201d requirements when the combination involves the Company and a person that beneficially owns 20% or more of the outstanding common stock, except under certain circumstances.\nIn addition, while two entities are currently the owner of approximately 75% of the issued and outstanding common stock, the likelihood of any offer to acquire a significant position in the Company\u2019s common stock is remote.\nThere is no established independent trading market for the shares of common stock of the Company.\nNo trading market presently exists for the shares of common stock and its value is therefore not determinable. Holders of our common stock do not have a vested right to redeem their shares, and therefore may not be able to liquidate their investment in the event of an emergency or otherwise. There simply is no active trading market for the shares of common stock, and accordingly, the transferability of such shares is limited at best.\nThe Company is managed by the Board of Directors.\nManagement has established the operating policies and procedures of the Company, which may be modified or waived by the Board of Directors without stockholder approval.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company\u2019s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. To manage such risks effectively, the Company enters into hedging transactions, pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk. Derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities, where appropriate. A secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non-specific exposure within established limits and policies; derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges. The potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the Company\u2019s results.\nThe global nature of the Company\u2019s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets. The Company has assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary objective of the Company\u2019s foreign currency risk management is to optimize the U.S. dollar value of net assets and cash flows. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts, over-the-counter option contracts, cross-currency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies. Exposures primarily relate to assets, liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies, as well as economic exposure, which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities. The largest exposures are denominated in European currencies, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, although exposures also exist in the Canadian dollar, the Indian rupee and other currencies in Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.\nThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges using interest rate swaps, \u201cswaptions,\u201d and exchange-traded instruments. The Company\u2019s primary exposure is to the U.S. dollar yield curve.\nThe Company has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries. This exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the Company\u2019s market risk policies and procedures.\nInherent in the Company\u2019s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. Some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments. Natural gas and crude oil, along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production, constitute the main commodity exposures. Over-the-counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks, when feasible.\nThe Company uses value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d), stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes. VAR estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values, given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time, using specified confidence levels. The VAR methodology used by the Company is a variance/covariance model. This model uses a 97.5 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data. The 2019 and 2018 year-end and average daily VAR for the aggregate of all positions are shown below. These amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s composite VAR for the aggregate of all positions decreased from $145 million at December 31, 2018 to $137 million at December 31, 2019. The interest rate and commodities VAR declined due to a decrease in exposure. The equity securities VAR declined due to a decrease in managed exposures and lower equity volatility. The foreign exchange VAR increased due to increased hedging.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk.\nValuation Risk\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and therefore, we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for\ndetermining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 100.0% of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates.\nBased on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2019, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments) assuming each floating rate investment is subject to 3-month LIBOR and there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:\nWe may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments.\nCurrency Risk\nFrom time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. We also have the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies under our credit facilities. Instead of entering into a foreign currency forward contract in connection with loans or other investments we have made that are denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan or investment. To the extent the loan or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our credit facilities, we may seek to utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary:\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, such as valuation risk and interest rate risk.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS\nWe are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity steel pricing, commodity energy prices, and interest rates. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows:\nForeign currency exchange rates - Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments, our operations in countries other than the U.S., and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end. We have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given that exposure to date has not been material. In 2019, changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced our reported net sales by $14.8 with the estimated effect on our net earnings being immaterial.\nCommodity steel pricing - We buy and sell various types of steel products; these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners and related hardware. We are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers. During 2019, the price of commodity steel as reflected in many market indexes has declined. During 2018, we experienced inflation in the cost of steel products. During 2017, we experienced some inflation in the cost of steel products.\nCommodity energy prices - We have market risk for changes in prices of oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity. Prices for gasoline and diesel were mostly stable over the course of 2019, resulting in our fuel costs being similarly stable during the period. This carried over from the latter part of 2018 when the costs of these commodities began to ease. However, through most of 2018 the prices of these commodities increased, resulting in higher fuel costs for our hub and field-based vehicles and utility costs for our in-market locations, distribution centers, and manufacturing facilities in the period. Fossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that we sell. As a result, rising costs for these commodities resulted in higher costs for many of these products. We believe that over time these risks are mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight and product costs to our customers, the efficiency of our trucking distribution network, and the ability, over time, to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency. In 2019, our estimated net earnings exposure for commodity energy prices was immaterial.\nInterest rates - Loans under our Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates tied to LIBOR (or, if LIBOR is no longer available, at a replacement rate to be determined by the administrative agent for the Credit Facility and consented to by us). As a result, changes in LIBOR can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place. We have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our Credit Facility. A one percentage point increase in LIBOR in 2019 would have resulted in approximately $3.2 of additional interest expense.

Interest rates associated with borrowings under the Credit Agreement can either be, at our election, (i) one-month or three-month LIBOR (Index) plus a spread between 0.700% and 0.900%, based on the Company's consolidated funded debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio or (ii) Prime (Index) plus 0.0%. Increases in interest rates would not currently impact our annual interest expense as we do not have any outstanding borrowings but could impact our annual interest expense on future borrowings.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are subject to commodity price risk primarily with respect to purchases of fuel and rubber. We have fuel surcharge agreements with most customers that enable us to pass through most long-term price increases therefore limiting our exposure to commodity price risk. Fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of fuel as we are not able to pass through fuel costs associated with out-of-route miles, empty miles, and tractor idle time. Based on our actual fuel purchases for 2020, assuming miles driven, fuel surcharges as a percentage of revenue, percentage of unproductive miles, and miles per gallon remained consistent with 2020 amounts, a $1.00 increase in the average price of fuel per gallon, year over year, would decrease our income before income taxes by approximately $8.2 million. We use a significant amount of tires to maintain our revenue equipment. We are not able to pass through 100% of price increases from tire suppliers due to the severity and timing of increases and current rate environment. Historically, we have sought to minimize tire price increases through bulk tire purchases from our suppliers. Based on our expected tire purchases for 2021, a 10% increase in the price of tires would increase our tire purchase expense by $1.4 million, resulting in a corresponding decrease in income before income taxes.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks faced by a company, including interest rate risk and commodity price risk.

(The Pavilion Lawsuit was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.) The Pavilion Lawsuit seeks injunctive relief, compensatory and treble damages, as well as attorney's fees, costs and expenses. Pegasus' products employ its own proprietary computer code as weml as computer code exclusively licensed to Pegasus. On September 15, 2000, the licensor agreed to defend Pegasus in the Pavilion Lawsuit pursuant to an indemnification provision of the parties' license agreement. On October 27, 2000, Pegasus filed an answer to the Pavilion Lawsuit denying the patent infringement claims (\"Pegasus' Answer\"). The Pegasus Answer also asserted various counterclaims against Pavilion alleging unfair competition, deceptive trade practices, defamation, tortious interference with business relationships and attempted monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (\"Pegasus' Counterclaims\"). After coosultation with counsel, KFx and Pegasus management believe that the infringement allegations in the Pavilion Lawsuit are objectively baseless and without merit. On April 11, 2001, Pegasus and Pavilion agreed to dismiss the Pavilion Lawsuit and the Pegasus Answer, without prejudice, in order to explore possible business combinations, cooperative relationships and other alternatives. To the extent that these efforts are not successful, Pegasus, in coordination with its licensor, intends to vigorously defend against the Pavilion Lawsuit and to aggressively pursue the Pegasus Answer and Pegasus Counterclaims. Accordingly, although the disposition of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that its ultimate outcome will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or the results of its operations.\nOn November 4, 1999, Link Resources, Inc., a Georgia corporation, (\"Link\") and its two shareholders, Linda E. Kobel (\"Kobel\") and Gary A. Sanden (\"Sanden\") filed a complaint against the Company in US District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaint alleges that KFx, Link, Kobel and Sanden had entered into an agreement requiring KFx to acquire Link and that KFx breached such agreement. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $5.3 million. Although the ultimate resolution of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on a review of the underlying facts and discussion with counsel, management believes that this complaint is without merit. KFx intends to contest this complaint vigorously.

We conduct all of our operations through subsidiaries, which are engaged predominantly in the business of waste and energy services.\nOur mission is to provide sustainable waste and energy solutions. We seek to do this through a variety of service offerings, including our core business of owning and operating infrastructure for the conversion of Waste-to-Energy (\u201cWtE\u201d).\nWtE facilities produce energy through the combustion of non-hazardous municipal solid waste (\u201cMSW\u201d) in specially-designed power plants. Most of our facilities are \u201cmass-burn\u201d facilities, which combust the MSW on an as-received basis without any pre-processing such as shredding, sorting or sizing. The process reduces the waste to an inert ash while extracting ferrous and non-ferrous metals for recycling. In addition to our mass-burn facilities, we own and/or operate additional facilities that use other processes or technologies, such as refuse-derived fuel facilities which process waste prior to combustion.\nWtE serves two key markets as both a sustainable waste management solution that is environmentally superior to landfilling and as a source of clean energy that reduces overall greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. WtE is considered renewable under the laws of many states and under federal law. Our facilities are critical infrastructure assets that allow our customers, which are principally municipal entities, to provide an essential public service through sustainable practices.\nOur WtE facilities earn revenue from the disposal of waste, generally under long-term contracts, the generation of electricity, and from the sale of metals recovered during the WtE process. We operate and/or have ownership positions in 41 WtE facilities currently in commercial operation, 39 of which are in North America. In total, these facilities process approximately 21 million tons of solid waste annually, equivalent to 8% of the post-recycled MSW generated in the United States (\"U.S.\"). Our facilities produce approximately 10 million megawatt hours (\u201cMWh\u201d) of baseload electricity annually. We also operate waste management infrastructure, including 13 waste transfer stations, 20 material processing facilities, four landfills (primarily for ash disposal), one metals processing facility, and one ash processing facility (currently in start-up and testing phase), all of which are complementary to our core WtE business.\nOutside of North America, we operate and/or have equity interests in WtE projects in Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom (\"UK\") and China (our projects in the UK and China are currently in development and/or under construction). We continue to evaluate additional opportunities for international WtE projects where the regulatory and market environments are attractive. For additional information, see Recent Business Developments below, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3. New Business and Asset Management.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe operate in foreign countries, which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the euro.\nAlthough approximately 70% of our sales are denominated in the U.S. dollar, we also invoice and collect in the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Chinese renminbi in their respective regions. The U.S dollar is the functional currency for all of VMware's legal entities. At the time a non-U.S. dollar transaction is recorded, the value of the transaction is converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect for the month in which each order is booked. As a result, the amount of license and total revenue derived from these transactions will be impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations.\nAdditionally, a portion of our operating expenses, primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services, sales and sales support and research and development, are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily those currencies in which we also invoice and collect. As exchange rates vary, operating results may differ materially from expectations.\nTo manage the risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward contracts (\u201cforward contracts\u201d), as described below.\nCash Flow Hedging Activities. To mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations resulting from certain operating expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies, we enter into forward contracts. We enter into forward contracts annually, which have maturities of twelve months or less. As of February 1, 2019 and February 2, 2018, we had outstanding forward contracts with a total notional value of $367 million and $318 million, respectively. The fair value of these forward contracts was not significant as of February 1, 2019 and February 2, 2018.\nForward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges. We enter into forward contracts to offset the foreign currency risk associated with net outstanding monetary asset and liability positions. Our forward contracts are traded on a monthly basis and typically have a contractual term of one month. As of February 1, 2019 and February 2, 2018, we had outstanding forward contracts with a total notional value of $1,208 million and $1,020 million, respectively. The fair value of these forward contracts was not significant as of February 1, 2019 and February 2, 2018.\nSensitivity Analysis. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. A hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10% would have resulted in a potential loss of $154 million in fair value of our forward contracts as of February 1, 2019. This sensitivity analysis is based on the notional value of our outstanding forward contracts as of February 1, 2019 and disregards any offsetting gain that may be associated with the underlying foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities that we hedge.\nThis analysis also assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however, foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially. We do not, and do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nInterest Rates. Our net income is affected by fluctuations in interest rates (e.g. interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on short-term investments). The Company's policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. The following table summarizes information related to the Company's interest rate market risk at December 31 (in millions):\nAs announced in July 2017, LIBOR is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely impact our interest rates and related interest expense. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $3.4 billion in variable rate indebtedness. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Other Liquidity Matters, of this report, for more information on interest expense.\nA change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Assuming our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments remain at their average 2019 levels, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the Company's interest income of approximately $47 million during 2020.\nCommodity Price Risk (Aircraft Fuel). The price of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the Company's operations, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nOur operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. To provide adequate supplies of fuel, the Company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel, and the Company generally has some ability to cover short-term fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations. The Company's current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge fuel price volatility, although the Company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors. The Company's 2020 forecasted fuel consumption is presently approximately 4.5 billion gallons, and based on this forecast, a one-dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the Company's annual fuel expense by approximately $108 million.\nForeign Currency. The Company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the Company's results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. Some of the Company's more significant foreign currency exposures include the Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, European euro, British pound and Japanese yen. The Company's current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency sales, although the Company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors.\nThe result of a uniform 1% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2019 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $23 million for the year ending December 31, 2020. This sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2020 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of December 31, 2019.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.

We are also exposed to fluctuations in fuel costs as we deliver a substantial portion of the products we sell by truck. We seek to minimize the effects of inflation and changing prices through economies of purchasing and inventory management, resulting in cost reductions and productivity improvements as well as price increases to maintain gross margins.\nProduct Price Risk\nOur business model is to buy and sell at current market prices in quantities approximately equal to estimated customer demand. We do not take significant \u201clong\u201d or \u201cshort\u201d positions in the products we sell in an attempt to speculate on changes in product prices. Because we maintain inventories in order to serve the needs of our customers, we are subject to the risk of reductions in market prices for the products we hold in inventory; however, we actively manage this risk by adjusting prices and managing our inventory levels.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk associated with our debt. While changes in interest rates do not affect the fair value of our variable-rate debt, they do affect future earnings and cash flows through higher interest expense. Interest rate swaps are entered into with the objective of converting variable to fixed rate debt, thereby reducing volatility in borrowing costs.\n\u2022\nThe ABL Facility bears interest (i) in the case of U.S. dollar-denominated loans, either at LIBOR or an alternate base rate, at our option, plus applicable borrowing margins and (ii) in the case of Canadian dollar denominated loans, either at the Bankers\u2019 Acceptances Rate or the Canadian Prime Rate, at our option, plus applicable borrowing margins. The borrowing margins are defined by a pricing grid, as included in the ABL Facility agreement, based on average excess availability for the previous quarter.\n\u2022\nThe Term Loan Facility bears interest at LIBOR (subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus a borrowing margin of 2.75% or an alternate base rate plus a borrowing margin of 1.75% at the borrower\u2019s election.\nA 1% increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt would increase our annual forecasted interest expense by approximately $1.4 million.\nCredit Risk\nWe have a credit policy in place and monitor exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. We perform credit evaluations on all customers requesting credit above a specified exposure level. In the normal course of business, we provide credit to our customers, perform ongoing credit evaluations of these customers, and maintain reserves for potential credit losses. Our typical credit terms extend 30 days from the date of purchase, but terms of up to 60 days are not uncommon. We typically have limited risk from a concentration of credit risk as no individual customer represents greater than 10% of the outstanding accounts receivable balance. Bad debt reserves, which we use as a proxy for our bad debt exposure, were approximately 3% of gross receivables as of December 29, 2019.\nInvestments, if any, are only in liquid securities and only with counterparties with appropriate credit ratings. Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties with which we have a signed netting agreement and which have appropriate credit ratings. We do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the potential risks associated with market fluctuations, such as changes in consumer spending, labor wages, fuel, fertilizer, and other material costs, home sales, unemployment rates, insurance costs, foreign exchange, and medical costs.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk, including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as described below. The primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term \u201cmarket risk\u201d refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe currently generate the majority of our revenues pursuant to fee-based agreements with Diamondback under which we are paid based on volumetric fees, rather than the underlying value of the commodity. Consequently, our existing operations and cash flow have little direct exposure to commodity price risk. However, Diamondback and our other customers are exposed to commodity price risk, and extended reduction in commodity prices could reduce the production volumes available for our midstream services in the future below expected levels. Although we intend to maintain fee-based pricing terms on both new contracts and existing contracts for which prices have not yet been set, our efforts to negotiate such terms may not be successful, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in a manner that increases our exposure to commodity price risk. Future exposure to the volatility of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to counterparty credit risk related to our midstream commercial contracts, lease agreements and related to our joint venture receivables. We derive substantially all of our revenue from our commercial agreements with Diamondback. As a result, we are directly affected by changes to Diamondback\u2019s business related to operational and business risks or otherwise. While we monitor the creditworthiness of purchasers, lessees and joint venture partners with which we conduct business, we are unable to predict sudden changes in solvency of these counterparties and may be exposed to associated risks. Nonperformance by a counterparty could result in significant financial losses.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under the Operating Company\u2019s credit agreement. The terms of the credit agreement provide for interest at a rate elected by the Operating Company that is based on the prime rate or LIBOR, in each case plus margins ranging from 0.250% to 1.250% for prime-based loans and 1.250% to 2.250% per annum for LIBOR loans, in each case depending on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement). The Operating Company is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.250% to 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the commitment, which fee is also dependent on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $424.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $176.0 million available for future borrowings under the credit agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement was 2.98% as of December 31, 2019. An increase or decrease of 1% in the interest rate would have a corresponding increase or decrease in our interest expense of approximately $4.2 million based on the $424.0 million outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2019.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text provides quantitative and qualitative information about the market risks faced by the company, including commodity price risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk.

Additional information\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2019 Form 10-K Page 41\nabout our long-term debt is disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, Long-term Debt, in the consolidated financial statements.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nRegulated Energy Segment\nWe have entered into agreements with various wholesale suppliers to purchase natural gas and electricity for resale to our customers. Our regulated energy distribution businesses that sell natural gas or electricity to end-use customers have fuel cost recovery mechanisms authorized by the PSCs that allow us to recover all of the costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas and electricity for our customers. Therefore, our regulated energy distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure.\nUnregulated Energy Segment\nOur propane operations are exposed to commodity price risk as a result of the competitive nature of retail pricing offered to our customers. In order to mitigate this risk, we utilize propane storage activities and forward contracts for supply.\nWe can store up to approximately 7.4 million gallons of propane (including leased storage and rail cars) during the winter season to meet our customers\u2019 peak requirements and to serve metered customers. Decreases in the wholesale price of propane may cause the value of stored propane to decline, particularly if we utilize fixed price forward contracts for supply. To mitigate the risk of propane commodity price fluctuations on the inventory valuation, we have adopted a Risk Management Policy that allows our propane distribution operation to enter into fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or other economic hedges of our inventory.\nAspire Energy is exposed to commodity price risk, primarily during the winter season, to the extent we are not successful in balancing our natural gas purchases and sales and have to secure natural gas from alternative sources at higher spot prices. In order to mitigate this risk, we procure firm capacity that meets our estimated volume requirements and we continue to seek out new producers in order to fulfill our natural gas purchase requirements.\nThe following table reflects the changes in the fair market value of financial derivatives contracts related to natural gas and propane purchases and sales from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019:\nThere were no changes in the methods of valuations during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following is a summary of fair market value of financial derivatives as of December 31, 2019, by method of valuation and by maturity for each fiscal year period.\nWHOLESALE CREDIT RISK\nThe Risk Management Committee reviews credit risks associated with counterparties to commodity derivative contracts prior to such contracts being approved.\nAdditional information about our derivative instruments is disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, Derivative Instruments, in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINFLATION\nInflation affects the cost of supply, labor, products and services required for operations, maintenance and capital improvements. To help cope with the effects of inflation on our capital investments and returns, we periodically seek rate increases from regulatory commissions for our regulated operations and closely monitor the returns of our unregulated energy business operations. To compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices, we adjust propane sales prices to the extent allowed by the market.\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation 2019 Form 10-K Page 42\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nChesapeake Utilities Corporation is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and wholesale credit risk.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOne of the principal market risks facing the Company is the risk of interest rate changes, primarily through its variable-rate revolving credit facility and term loans. The Company\u2019s objectives with respect to interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows, and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, the Company may borrow at either fixed rates or at variable rates and enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to mitigate its interest rate risk. The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. The Company is not directly subject to foreign currency risk.\nThe Company has entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which convert the LIBOR rates to fixed rates for certain unsecured term loans. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $18.9 million included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet relating to the fair value of the interest rate swaps applicable to certain unsecured term loans.\nAt December 31, 2020, long-term debt consisted of a fixed-rate mortgage loan payable, a finance lease obligation, unsecured term loans, and the Company\u2019s unsecured variable-rate credit facility. Excluding unamortized premiums and debt issuance costs, the average interest rate on the $476.3 million of fixed-rate debt outstanding was 3.9%, with maturities at various dates through 2050. The average interest rate on the $150.0 million of variable-rate debt outstanding, which consists of a portion of the unsecured revolving credit facility and a term loan, was 1.8%. With respect to the $150.0 million of variable-rate debt, if contractual interest rates either increase or decrease by 100 bps, the Company\u2019s interest cost would increase or decrease respectively by approximately $1.5 million per annum.\nWith respect to the Company\u2019s fixed rate mortgage and unsecured term loans, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the Company\u2019s interest expense as these notes are at fixed rates for extended terms. Because the Company presently intends to hold its existing fixed-rate debt either to maturity or until the sale of the associated property, these fixed-rate notes pose an interest rate risk to the Company\u2019s results of operations and its working capital position only upon the refinancing of that indebtedness. The Company\u2019s possible risk is from increases in long-term interest rates that may occur as this may increase the cost of refinancing maturing fixed-rate debt.

The Company's long-term debt consists of a fixed-rate mortgage loan payable, a finance lease obligation, unsecured term loans, and the Company\u2019s unsecured variable-rate credit facility. Changes in interest rates generally do not affect the Company\u2019s interest expense as these notes are at fixed rates for extended terms, however the Company may incur prepayment penalties or defeasance costs when prepaying or defeasing debt."}
{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe following discussion about Geron's market risk disclosures contains forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. The fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2000 was $95.1 million. These investments include $29.3 million of cash and cash equivalents which are due in less than 90 days, $3.0 million of short-term investments which are due in less than one year and $62.8 million in long-term investments which are due in one to two years. Our investment policy is to manage our marketable\nsecurities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities. We primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short-term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds. Although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses, such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold. Due to the nature of our investments, which are primarily corporate and municipal notes and money market funds, we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. Because we translate foreign currencies into United States dollars for reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact, though generally immaterial, on our results. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiary satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currencies. For the fiscal 2000 year end, there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions. However, the financial obligations of Geron to the Roslin Institute are stated in British pounds sterling over the next five years. This obligation may become more expensive for us if the United States dollar becomes weaker against the British pounds sterling. As of December 31, 2000, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Geron is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

Trust, Pagan Lewis Motors, Inc., Jack Pagan, Allan Pagan and Paul Rice filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee against MerchantOnline, Tarek Kirschen, Michael Karsch and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The complaint alleges that MerchantOnline breached its agreement with Pagan Lewis Motors by failing to make the final payment of $124,291 due under this agreement. In January 2001, the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction requiring the defendants to take all necessary actions to permit plaintiffs to sell any restricted MerchantOnline common stock owned by them both\npersonally and to sell sufficient shares to pay all amounts due. MerchantOnline does not dispute the $124,291 due under the agreement but intends to contest the other allegations contained in the complaint. The parties have been engaged in settlement discussions and MerchantOnline believes that the action will be settled upon receipt of funding.\nOn February 9, 2001, MerchantOnline was served in a case entitled Elliott, Lane & Associates Inc. vs. MerchantOnline.com, Inc. filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, San Diego County. The plaintiffs were issued restricted stock pursuant to a consulting agreement in November 1999 and claim that MerchantOnline has failed to issue a 144 opinion on a sale. MerchantOnline intends to contest the allegations on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to perform their obligations under the original consulting agreement.\nMerchantOnline has been notified by Don Hughes, Kim Wilson and Jim Terhune, former shareholders of ChargeSolutions and Approve.net, that they intend to file actions against MerchantOnline. Messrs. Hughes and Terhune are claiming that they are entitled to substantial option grants and other benefits pursuant to their employment agreements. The board of MerchantOnline requested the compensation committee review the claims. The committee made recommendation to the full board, which were rejected by Messrs. Hughes and Terhune.\nMs. Wilson has claimed that MerchantOnline is preventing her from selling restricted stock acquired in the Approve.net transaction. MerchantOnline believes that Ms. Wilson is an affiliate due to her personal relationship with Mr. Hughes, who is currently an officer and was formerly a director, and is prohibiting sales by insiders during insider blackout periods in accordance with company policy.\nOn March 13, 2001, Mr. Hughes resigned as a director. In his letter he stated that he resigned over what he considered to be unethical business practices by members of the senior management team of MerchantOnline, some members of the board of directors and the lack of response in his attempts to ascertain relevant information to adequately protect the interests of the shareholders and questionable business practices. (MerchantOnline believes that Mr. Hughes is incorrect, has been provided access to all information that he requested and that no questionable actions have been taken by member of senior management). Further, Mr. Hughes has made a series of claims against MerchantOnline and has threatened to report MerchantOnline to various authorities for undisclosed violations. Other than back salaries and expenses owed to him and payroll taxes owed, Mr. Hughes has not substantiated any of his claims.

LCNB attempts to mitigate this risk through asset/liability management strategies designed to decrease the vulnerability of its earnings to material and prolonged changes in interest rates. LCNB does not use derivatives such as interest rate swaps, caps or floors to hedge this risk. LCNB has not entered into any market risk instruments for trading purposes.\nThe Bank's Asset and Liability Management Committee (\"ALCO\") primarily uses a combination of Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis (IRSA) and Economic Value of Equity (EVE) analysis for measuring and managing interest rate risk. The IRSA model is used to estimate the effect on net interest income during a one-year period of instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates, also called interest rate shocks, of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points. Management considers the results of any downward scenarios of more than 100 basis points to not be meaningful in the current interest rate environment. The base projection uses a current interest rate scenario. As shown below, the December 31, 2020 IRSA indicates that an increase in interest rates at all shock levels will have a positive effect on net interest income and a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates will have a negative effect on net interest income. The changes in net interest income for all rate assumptions are within LCNB\u2019s acceptable ranges.\nIRSA shows the effect on net interest income during a one-year period only. A more long-range model is the EVE analysis, which shows the estimated present value of future cash inflows from interest-earning assets less the present value of future cash outflows for interest-bearing liabilities for the same rate shocks. As shown below, the December 31, 2020 EVE analysis indicates that an increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on the EVE for all shock levels and a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would have a positive effect. The changes in the EVE for all rate assumptions are within LCNB\u2019s acceptable ranges.\nThe IRSA and EVE simulations discussed above are not projections of future income or equity and should not be relied on as being indicative of future operating results. Assumptions used, including the nature and timing of interest rate levels, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows, are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the models cannot precisely measure future net interest income or equity.

Many of the matters relate to the use, handling, processing, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous materials. The Company believes that the resolution of such lawsuits and claims, including those described below, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but could be material to the results of operations of the Company in any one accounting period.\nThe Company is one of several alleged processors of lead, lead pigments and/or lead-based paints named as defendants in 12 cases pending in state and federal courts in the states of New York, Ohio, Maryland, Rhode Island, Missouri, California, Texas, Illinois and Wisconsin. The suits have been brought by governmental entities and individual plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others. The suits variously seek injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages, including for the cost of monitoring, detecting and removing lead-based paints from buildings; for personal injuries allegedly caused by ingestion of lead-based paints; and plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. The Company is sued primarily as the alleged successor to MacGregor Lead Company from which the Company purchased certain assets in 1971. The Company denies it is a successor to MacGregor Lead Company. In some cases there are allegations that the Company is liable in its own right, but none of the complaint specifies any acts on which such liability could be based.\nIn January 1999 the Company received a subpoena to testify before, and provide documents to, a federal grand jury in California investigating the carbon fiber and prepreg industry.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are exposed to market risks, which include changes in interest rates, changes in foreign currency exchange rate as measured against the U.S. dollar and changes in the value of stock of a publicly traded company which secures a promissory note we hold.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit borrowings and variable rate term loans, which totaled $20.9 million at March 31, 2000. Based on this balance, a change in one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately $0.2 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, on an annual basis.\nThese instruments were not entered into for trading purposes and carry interest at a pre-agreed upon percentage point spread from the bank's prime interest rate. Our objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed-rate borrowings.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\nWe conduct business in various foreign currencies, primarily in Europe and Australia. Sales are typically denominated in the local foreign currency, which creates exposures to changes in exchange rates. These changes in the foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively affect our sales, gross margins and retained earnings. We attempt to minimize currency exposure risk through decentralized sales, development, marketing and support operations, in which substantially all costs are local-currency based. There can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the foreign currency. We do not hedge against foreign currency risk. Approximately 37%, 83% and 97% of our total net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods ended March 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.\nEQUITY PRICE RISK\nWe have no direct equity investments. However, we have a note receivable in the amount of $14.1 million which is secured by shares of the common stock of Integrity Software, Inc. (\"Integrity\"), a publicly traded company with shares quoted on the National Quotation Bureau Pink Sheets. We also have the right to convert the note into common stock of Integrity at a fixed price. We are therefore exposed to indirect equity price risk. We have not taken steps to mitigate this risk, and a decline in the trading price of Integrity common stock may impair the value of and our ability to collect the $14.1 million receivable.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and equity price risk.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from market changes) to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates, price risk and project cancellation risk.\nThe assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate, price risk and project cancellation risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods, our current knowledge of the marketplace, and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate.\nForeign Currency\nInternational consolidated sales for fiscal 2020 were 36% of total sales, up from 35% of sales in fiscal 2019. Operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates, including the recent increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies. Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified. In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. In fiscal 2020, substantially all sales by us and our wholly owned subsidiaries, for which we were paid, were denominated in the local currency of the respective subsidiary (U.S. dollars or Chinese RMB).\nWe have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases. In fiscal 2020, our purchases in foreign currencies represented 1% of the cost of products sold. At certain times, we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales and purchase contracts negotiated in foreign currencies. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not used in fiscal 2020 and as of March 31, 2020, we held no forward foreign currency contracts.\nPrice Risk\nOperating in a global marketplace requires us to compete with other global manufacturers which, in some instances, benefit from lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions. Although we believe that our customers differentiate our products on the basis of our manufacturing quality and engineering experience and excellence, among other things, such lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions mean that our competitors are able to offer products similar to ours at lower prices. In extreme market downturns, such as we recently experienced, we typically see depressed price levels. Moreover, the cost of metals and other materials used in our products have experienced significant volatility. Such factors, in addition to the global effects of the recent volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, have resulted in downward demand and pricing pressure on our products.\nProject Cancellation and Project Continuation Risk\nAdverse economic or specific project conditions can lead to a project being placed on hold or cancelled by our customers. In fiscal 2020, we had two projects totaling $3,165 cancelled. In fiscal 2019, we had no projects cancelled. At March 31, 2020, we had two projects totaling $562 on hold. At March 31, 2019, we had no projects on hold. We attempt to mitigate the risk of cancellation by structuring contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred. As a result, we do not believe we have a significant cash exposure to projects which may be cancelled.\nOpen orders are reviewed continuously through communications with customers. If it becomes evident to us that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date, management will move the project into \"placed on hold\" (i.e., suspended) category. Furthermore, if a project is cancelled by our customer, it is removed from our backlog.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: This text discusses the market risks to which the company is exposed, including foreign currency exchange rates, price risk, and project cancellation risk.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Credit Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates.\nWe are potentially exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect interest earned on our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, $127.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in operating bank accounts and money market funds earning nominal interest. Accordingly, we do not believe that a 10% change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income, operating results or liquidity related to these amounts.\nThe primary objectives of our investment activities are, in order of importance, to preserve principal, provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. We do not currently use or plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily maintained by financial institutions in the United States, Canada, India and Hong Kong, and our current deposits are likely in excess of insurance limits.\nOur accounts receivable primarily relate to revenue earned from Digital Storefront operators and advertising platforms.

At December 31, 2019, Apple Inc., or Apple, accounted for 47.2%, Google Inc., or Google, accounted for 28.5% and Tapjoy Inc., or Tapjoy accounted for 17.8% of total accounts receivable. At December 31, 2018, Apple accounted for 40.8%, Google accounted for 30.3% and Tapjoy accounted for 21.1% of total accounts receivable. No other customer or Digital Storefront represented more than 10% of our total accounts receivable as of these dates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business in more than 100 countries in more than 30 different currencies, and in 2019 and 2018, some of these currencies fluctuated significantly. Our operations outside of the United States are maintained in their local currency, with the significant operating currencies consisting of the Indian Rupee and Canadian Dollar. Although recording operating expenses in the local currency of our foreign operations mitigates some of the exposure of foreign currency fluctuations, variances among the currencies of our customers and our foreign operations relative to the United States Dollar, or USD, could have and have had a material impact on our results of operations.\nOur foreign currency exchange gains and losses have been generated primarily from fluctuations the Indian Rupee versus the USD and the Canadian Dollar versus the USD. At month-end, non-functional currency-denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in interest and other income/(expense), net. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders\u2019 equity. We have in the past experienced, and in the future expect to experience, foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nTo date, we have not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities, and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

{"section": "ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.\nIn April 2020, we received invoices from each of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) in the amounts of $702,600 and $92,100, respectively, for our share of the PCAOB and FASB Issuer Accounting Support Fee for calendar year 2020. The fees were due May 18, 2020. We have petitioned the PCAOB and FASB to review our fee assessments and are in the process of review.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company records accruals for certain of its outstanding legal proceedings, investigations or claims when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations or claims that could affect the amount of any accrual, as well as any developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company discloses the amount of the accrual if the financial statements would be otherwise misleading.\nWhen a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability. However, if the loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then the Company discloses an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss, if such estimate can be made or discloses that an estimate cannot be made.\nThe assessments whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involve a series of complex judgments about future events. Management is often unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (i) the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large number of parties. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, fine, penalty or business impact, if any.\nWe expect that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, within the accruals established, if any, for such legal proceeding is likely to range from approximately $800,000 and upwards if penalties or interest are assessed against us in the even that we are unable to timely pay assessed amounts. The estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Company is involved, taking into account the Company\u2019s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe principal market risk (i.e. the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the Company is exposed is foreign exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the Polish zloty currency exchange rate. The Company's long term debt is primarily subject to a fixed rate, and therefore variations in the interest rate do not have a material impact on net interest expense.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKET RISKS\nOperating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rate movements typically affect economic growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, can cause the Company to adjust its financing and operating strategies. The discussion of changes in currency exchange rates below does not incorporate these other important economic factors.\nInternational operations constitute 100% of the Company's 2000 consolidated operating loss. Some of the Company's operating expenses and capital expenditures are expected to continue to be denominated in or indexed in U.S. dollars. By contrast, substantially all of the Company's revenues are denominated in zloty. Any devaluation of the zloty against the U.S. dollar that the Company is unable to offset through price adjustments will require it to use a larger portion of its revenue to service its U.S. dollar denominated obligations and contractual commitments.\nThe Company estimates that a 10% change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2000 by approximately $1.8 million. In other terms, a 10% depreciation of the Polish zloty against the U.S. dollar, would result in a $1.8 million decrease in the reported operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2000. This was estimated using 10% of the Company's operating loss after adjusting for unusual impairment and other items including U.S. dollar denominated or indexed expenses. The Company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because, as discussed in the first paragraph of this section, it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or the Company's financing or operating strategies.\nThe Company does not generally hedge translation risk. While the Company may consider entering into transactions to hedge the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain hedging arrangements on commercially satisfactory terms. Therefore, shifts in currency exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results and on its ability to meet its U.S. dollar denominated debt obligations and contractual commitments.\nPoland has historically experienced high levels of inflation and significant fluctuations in the exchange rate for the zloty. The Polish government has adopted policies that slowed the annual rate of inflation from approximately 250% in 1990 to approximately 11.8% in 1998, approximately 7.3% in 1999 and 10.1% in 2000. The exchange rate for the zloty has stabilized and the rate of devaluation of the zloty has generally decreased since 1991. The zloty depreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 1999. However for the year ended December 31, 2000, the zloty has appreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 0.12%. Inflation and currency exchange fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the Polish zloty currency exchange rate.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company's outstanding debt was $3.5 billion, of which $2.9 billion bears interest at fixed rates. If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $121.1 million. Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. The $425 million MTCH Term Loan and the $247.5 million outstanding balance on the ANGI Term Loan bear interest at variable rates. The MTCH Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%. As of December 31, 2019, the rate in effect was 4.44%. If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, then the annual interest expense on the MTCH Term Loan would increase or decrease by $4.3 million. The ANGI Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. As of December 31, 2019, the rate in effect was approximately 3.25%. If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, then the annual interest expense on the ANGI Term Loan would increase or decrease by $2.5 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nThe Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in various jurisdictions within the European Union, and, as a result, is exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the Euro and British Pound (\"GBP\").\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, international revenue accounted for 35%, 34% and 30%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. The Company has exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of the statement of operations of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.\nThe Company is also exposed to foreign currency transaction gains and losses to the extent it or its subsidiaries conduct transactions in and/or have assets and/or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency. The Company recorded foreign exchange (losses) and gains of $(1.0) million, $5.3 million and $(16.8) million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in GBP versus the U.S. dollar during 2018 and 2017, generated the majority of the Company's foreign currency exchange gains and losses in these years. The foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily related to a U.S. dollar denominated intercompany loan related to a 2016 acquisition in which the receivable is held by a foreign subsidiary with a GBP functional currency. The foreign exchange losses in 2017 were further impacted by U.S. dollar denominated cash, the majority of which is from the proceeds received in the PriceRunner sale in March 2016, held by a foreign subsidiary with a GBP functional currency. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company moved this U.S. dollar denominated cash to a U.S. dollar functional currency entity.\nForeign currency exchange gains or losses historically have not been material to the Company. As a result, historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency exposures. The continued growth and expansion of our international operations increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies, could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: The Company is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency and inflation. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding these risks.\nInterest Rate Risk. Our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our New Credit Facilities, which carry variable interest rates. Interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates. Our New Credit Facilities include the New Term Loan Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility with advances tied to a borrowing base and which bear interest at a variable rate. Because our New Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2019, we had $242.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding under our New Credit Facilities, consisting of $216.5 million outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility (net of unamortized discount of $3.8 million) and $25.8 million in outstanding variable rate borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our debt levels on December 31, 2019, an increase or decrease of 1% in the effective interest rate would cause an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately $2.2 million over the next 12 months. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future.\nForeign Currency Risk. In January 2017, we acquired certain assets of Underground Toys Limited and now sell directly to certain of our customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa through our subsidiary, Funko UK, Ltd. While currently our inventory purchases for Funko UK, Ltd. are in U.S. dollars, their product sales are primarily in British pounds and euros. Funko UK, Ltd. also incurs a portion of its operating expenses in British pounds. In addition, we have other international subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong that primarily incur operating expenses in local currency and use the local currency as each subsidiary's functional currency. Therefore, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the British pound and euro. However, we believe that the exposure to foreign currency fluctuation from product sales and operating expenses is not significant at this time. As we grow our operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange contracts and currently do not expect to enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nImpact of Inflation. Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our historical results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial. We cannot assure you, however, that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nFunko, Inc. is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency and inflation.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nMarket risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we are primarily exposed to foreign currency, interest rate and fuel and certain other commodity risks.\nInterest Rate Market Risk\nThe Term Loan Facility and the asset-based Revolving Credit Facility are subject to changing interest rates. Although changes in interest rates do not impact our operating income, the changes could affect the fair value of such debt and related interest payments. An increase of 1% on our variable rate debt balance at December 31, 2019 would result in an increase to interest expense, net of $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As part of our strategy to limit exposure to interest rate risk, we entered into two interest rate swaps in the second quarter of 2018 with notional amount of $275 million and $225 million, which decreased to $175 million on June 30, 2019 as scheduled, to convert the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate. Refer to Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statement and Supplementary Data,\" Note 8, \"Long-Term Debt/ Interest Expense\" for more information. A decrease in the current interest rates would have no impact on interest expense due to an interest rate floor that exists under the Term Loan Facility.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Market Risk\nWe are subject to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes in the conversion from local currencies to the U.S. dollar of the reported financial position and operating results of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries. The primary currencies to which we are exposed to fluctuations are the Canadian Dollar, the Chinese Renminbi, Hong Kong Dollar, the British Pound, and the Euro. The impact of foreign exchange rate changes to our revenue in 2019 compared with 2018 was approximately $2.7 million. In addition, since our international franchisees pay for product sales and royalties to us in the U.S. dollar, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to our franchisees' local currency could adversely impact our revenue.\nWe have intercompany balances with foreign entities that are routinely settled primarily relating to product sales and management fees. Gains or losses resulting from these foreign currency transactions were not material for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nFuel Price Market Risk\nWe rely on our ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to our distribution centers and stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea and truck. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements which may have a favorable or unfavorable impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of margins and SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with inflation.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As our overseas operations expand, our exposure to the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations will continue to increase.\nInterest rate risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and receivable discount programs, which have interest costs that vary with interest rate movements. Our credit facility bears interest at variable base rates, plus an applicable margin. At March 31, 2020, our net debt obligations totaled $176,140,000. If interest rates were to increase 1%, our net annual interest expense would have increased by approximately $1,761,000. In addition, for each $10,000,000 of accounts receivable we discount over a period of 180 days, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense by $50,000.\nForeign currency risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our anticipated purchases and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in the following foreign currencies; Mexican pesos, Malaysian ringit, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan, and the Canadian dollar. Our primary currency risks result from fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso and to a lesser extent the Chinese yuan. To mitigate these risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for these foreign currencies. The extent to which we use forward foreign currency exchange contracts is periodically reviewed in light of our estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of anticipated requirements. The use of derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash outflow resulting from funding the expenses of the foreign operations will be materially affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts generally expire in a year or less. Any changes in the fair values of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts are reflected in current period earnings. Based upon our forward foreign currency exchange contracts related to these currencies, an increase of 10% in exchange rates at March 31, 2020 would have increased our general and administrative expenses by approximately $3,252,000. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, losses of $6,491,000 and $972,000, respectively, were recorded in general and administrative expenses due to the change in the value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts subsequent to entering into the contracts. In addition, we recorded a loss of $11,710,000 in general and administrative expenses in connection with the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities during fiscal 2020.\nCredit Risk\nWe regularly review our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the accounts receivable, and the current economic conditions that may affect a customer\u2019s ability to pay such amounts owed to us. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that, in our opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover losses that may be incurred.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the primary market risks faced by the company, which include changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and customer credit.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to certain market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. We seek to minimize any material risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We used forward foreign currency contracts to manage our currency rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2020, and, in order to manage our interest rate risk, we may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swaps to balance the ratio of fixed to floating rate debt. We do not use such instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Information regarding our accounting policy on financial instruments is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Rates\nThe market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. Our fixed rate interest exposure was 100% as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, a change in interest rates of 1% would not have a material impact on consolidated interest expense. Information regarding our Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Agreement is contained in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nAlthough the majority of our business is transacted in U.S. dollars, we do have market risk exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily as it relates to the value of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Canadian dollar, and Euro. Any significant change against the U.S. dollar in the value of the currencies of those countries in which we do business could have an effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If foreign exchange rates were to collectively weaken or strengthen against the U.S. dollar by 10%, net earnings would have decreased or increased, respectively, by approximately $8 million as it relates exclusively to foreign currency exchange rate exposures.\nFinancial instruments expose us to counter-party credit risk for non-performance and to market risk for changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We manage exposure to counter-party credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counter-parties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our investments by investing primarily in investment grade interest-bearing securities, which have short-term maturities.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk and to a lesser extent, foreign currency risk. We may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and fund acquisition, expansion, and financing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our net debt was approximately $712.7 million, which included approximately $302.2 million in fixed rate debt, $417.5 million in variable rate debt and approximately $0.6 million in net debt premium less approximately $7.6 million in net debt issuance costs. As of December 31, 2018, our net debt was approximately $406.1 million, which included approximately $225.6 million in fixed rate debt, $182.6 million in variable rate debt and approximately $1.2 million in net debt premium less approximately $3.4 million in net debt issuance costs. Our debt instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable debt. A change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts its fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on variable debt could impact the interest incurred and cash flows and its fair value. If the underlying rate of the related index on our variable rate debt were to increase by 100 basis points, the increase in interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.0 million annually.\nInterest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates. The primary objective of monitoring our interest rate sensitivity, or risk, is to provide management the tools necessary to manage the balance sheet to minimize adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates. Federal Reserve Board monetary control efforts, the effects of deregulation, economic uncertainty and legislative changes have been significant factors affecting the task of managing interest rate sensitivity positions in recent years.\nIn an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates, management closely monitors our exposure to interest rate risk through our ALCO. Our ALCO meets regularly and reviews our interest rate risk position and makes recommendations to our board for adjusting this position. In addition, our board reviews our asset/liability position on a monthly basis. We primarily use two methods for measuring and analyzing interest rate risk: net income simulation analysis and MVPE modeling. We utilize the net income simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. This model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next 12 months. The model is used to measure the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of rates immediately increasing 100 and 200 basis points or decreasing 100 and 200 basis points over the next 12 months. These simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix, pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet. The impact of interest rate-related risks such as prepayment, basis and option risk are also considered. Due to the low level of interest rates, many of the current interest rates cannot decline 100 or 200 basis points. The model has floors for each of those interest rates, and none are assumed to go negative.\nThe following table reflects the noted increases and decreases in interest rates under the model simulations and the anticipated impact on net interest income relative to the base case over the next twelve months for the periods presented.\nAs part of the overall assumptions, certain assets and liabilities are given reasonable floors. This type of simulation analysis requires numerous assumptions including but not limited to changes in balance sheet mix, prepayment rates on mortgage-related assets and fixed rate loans, cash flows and repricing of all financial instruments, changes in volumes and pricing, future shapes of the yield curve, relationship of market interest rates to each other (basis risk), credit spread and deposit sensitivity. Assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates but may not accurately reflect actual results under certain changes in interest rates.\nThe ALCO monitors various liquidity ratios to ensure a satisfactory liquidity position for us. Management continually evaluates the condition of the economy, the pattern of market interest rates and other economic data to determine the types of investments that should be made and at what maturities. Using this analysis, management from time to time assumes calculated interest sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in the general level of interest rates. Regulatory authorities also monitor our gap position along with other liquidity ratios. In addition, as described above, we utilize a simulation model to determine the impact of net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios. By utilizing this technology, we can determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mixes to mitigate the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK is a disclosure about the banking industry's risk exposure to changing interest rates. The primary objective of monitoring this risk is to provide management with the tools necessary to manage the balance sheet and minimize adverse changes in net interest income.

Legal Proceedings.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings which may include commercial, employment, tax, customs and trade, customer, vendor, personal injury, creditors rights and health and safety law matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company is from time to time subjected to various assertions, claims, proceedings and requests for damages and/or indemnification concerning sales channel practices and intellectual property matters, including patent infringement suits involving technologies that are incorporated in a broad spectrum of products the Company sells or that are incorporated in the Company\u2019s e-commerce sales channels, as well as trademark/copyright infringement claims. The Company is also audited by (or has initiated voluntary disclosure agreements with) various U.S. Federal and state authorities, as well as Canadian authorities, concerning potential income tax, sales tax and/or \"unclaimed property\" liabilities. These matters are in various stages of investigation, negotiation and/or litigation. The Company's former NATG operations is also being audited by an entity representing 28 states seeking recovery of \u201cunclaimed property\u201d and has received separate demands from 20 states requesting payments of their claimed amounts. The Company is complying with the unclaimed property audit, is providing requested information and is corresponding with the states regarding possible further discussions. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters and believes it has strong defenses. In September 2017 the Company and certain subsidiaries comprising its former NATG \"Tiger\" consumer electronics business were sued in United States District Court, Northern District of California by a software publisher alleging that the NATG subsidiaries violated certain contractual sales channel restrictions resulting in claims of breach of contract and trademark/copyright infringement. This matter was settled in 2019 without material impact to the Company.\nAlthough the Company does not expect, based on currently available information, that the outcome in any of these matters, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations, the ultimate outcome is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, judgments could be rendered or settlements entered, that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results or cash flows in a particular period. The Company regularly assesses all of its litigation and threatened litigation as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records its best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where it assesses the likelihood of loss as probable and estimable. In this regard, the Company establishes accrual estimates for its various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred at the date of the financial statements and the loss can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2019 the Company has established accruals for certain of its various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings based upon estimates of the most likely outcome in a range of loss or the minimum amounts in a range of loss if no amount within a range is a more likely estimate. The Company does not believe that at December 31, 2019 any reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued would be material to the financial statements.\nItem 4.", "summary": "Mine Safety Disclosures\n\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings related to commercial, employment, tax, customs and trade, customer, vendor, personal injury, creditors rights and health and safety law matters.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nHEDGES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into and may in the future enter into arrangements to hedge our oil and natural gas production, whereby gains and losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity. The hedges that we have entered into generally provide a 'floor' or 'cap and floor' on the prices paid for our oil and natural gas production over a period of time. Hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including the following:\no our production does not meet the minimum production requirements under the agreement;\no the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations; or\no there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received.\nDue to our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, we believe that the use of such derivative instruments does not expose us to material risk, however, the use of derivative instruments for the hedging activities could affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. The use of such instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, but it may also limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements.\nOur hedging strategy is designed to provide protection from low commodity prices while providing some opportunity to enjoy the benefits of higher commodity prices. We have a series of natural gas futures contracts with Bank of Montreal and with an affiliate of Enron. This strategy is designed to provide a degree of protection of negative shifts in natural gas prices as reported on the Henry Hub Nymex Index on approximately 73% of our expected natural gas production from reserves currently classified as proved developed producing during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001. At the same time, we are able to participate completely in upward movements in the Henry Hub Nymex Index to the extent of approximately 76% of our expected natural gas production for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001.\nIn addition to our natural gas hedging agreements, at June 30, 2000, we have a contract on 5,000 barrels of oil per month involving floor and ceiling prices of $22.00 and $28.63 per barrel, respectively, from July 1 through December 31, 2000.\nAs of June 30, 2000 the fair value of our hedging contracts, measured as the estimated cost we would incur to terminate the arrangements, was $5.3 million. As of June 30, 2000 a 10% increase in oil and natural gas prices would have resulted in an unfavorable change of $2.0 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts and a 10% decrease in oil and natural gas prices would have resulted in a favorable change of $2.1 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts.\nINTEREST RATES\nAt June 30, 2000, our exposure to interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement. As of June 30, 2000, we are not using any derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Interest is payable on borrowings under the credit agreement based on a floating rate. If short-term interest rates average 10% higher during our fiscal year 2001 than they were during 2000, our interest expense would increase by approximately $213,000. This amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change of 10% to our outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement at June 30, 2000.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the use of hedging instruments to reduce exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\nInterest Rate Hedging Activities\nThe Company\u2019s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had entered into five interest rate swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows on $175.0 million of the unsecured term debt. As of December 31, 2019, the Company also had $255.4 million of secured variable rate indebtedness. All of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the notional amount, carrying value, and estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s cash flow hedge derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of December 31, 2019. The notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rates or market risks. The table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on the Company\u2019s derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10-year Treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points, as of December 31, 2019.\nAdditionally, the Company has entered into total return swap contracts, with an aggregate notional amount of $255.4 million that effectively convert $255.4 million of fixed mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on the SIFMA plus a spread and have a carrying value of zero at December 31, 2019. The Company is exposed to insignificant interest rate risk on these swaps as the related mortgages are callable, at par, by the Company, co-terminus with the termination of any related swap. These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.\nInterest Rate Sensitive Liabilities\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long-term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company\u2019s real estate investment portfolio and operations. The Company\u2019s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, the Company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nThe Company\u2019s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows. Management has estimated the fair value of the Company\u2019s $5.2 billion of fixed rate debt at December 31, 2019, to be $5.4 billion. Management has estimated the fair value of the Company\u2019s $660.4 million of variable rate debt at December 31, 2019, to be $655.8 million based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace. The following table represents scheduled principal payments ($ in thousands):\n(1)\n$175.0 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements ($175.0 million is subject to interest rate swaps). $255.4 million is subject to total return swaps.\nThe table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2019; it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage this risk in a cost-effective manner, we, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts. We account for our derivative and hedging activities using the Financial Accounting Standard Board\u2019s guidance which requires all derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. For derivative transactions designated as hedges, we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction.\nDerivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) within shareholders\u2019 equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings. From time to time, we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions. Such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability.\nFor hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short-cut method, at the hedge\u2019s inception and on a regular basis thereafter, a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future.\nThe fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates obtained from the counterparties. We assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis. We performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2019 and 2018 and determined the hedges to be highly effective. Although we do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties to interest rate swap agreements, the counterparties expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nDuring 2015, we entered into nine forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we paid a fixed rate on a total notional amount of $1.0 billion and received one-month LIBOR. The average fixed rate payable on these swaps, all of which matured on April 15, 2019, was 1.31%.\nAlthough we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately do so, we are currently monitoring the interest rate environment and evaluating the terms of potential replacement interest rate swaps that we may enter into for a large portion, or potentially all, of the $1 billion total notional amount that expired on April 15, 2019.\nThe table below presents information about our long-term financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2019.

{"section": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nGeneral\nThe Company is a Delaware corporation which, prior to 1998, was engaged in the specialty packaging business, primarily as a supplier of packaging products to the agricultural industry. During 1997, the Company commenced an orderly liquidation of its assets (described below) which was completed in 1997. At present, management of the Company is seeking to secure a suitable merger partner wishing to go public or to acquire private companies to create investment value for the Company. For purposes of Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Company is considered a shell company.\nHistory\nPrior Business Operations\nThe Company was established in July of 1993 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dawson Geophysical Company (\u201cDawson\u201d and formerly known TGC Industries, Inc.). On July 30, 1993, the Company purchased certain assets of Union Camp Corporation\u2019s packaging division for a purchase price of approximately $6.14 million. The assets purchased included substantially all of the business of weaving and constructing Saxolin \u00d2 paper mesh and polypropylene plastic mesh bagging material for agricultural and industrial applications and substantially all of the properties related to Union Camp\u2019s packaging division. The properties acquired by Chase consisted of Union Camp\u2019s plant facilities located in Portland, Oregon, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, and all machinery, equipment, and inventories connected with these facilities.\nThe Company experienced losses from 1994 through 1997, and in 1997 the Company\u2019s secured lender decided not to renew the Company\u2019s operating line of credit. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors therefore determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and all of its creditors to liquidate in an orderly fashion.\nEffective July 21, 1997, the Company sold its operations at Idaho Falls, Idaho, to Lockwood Packing Corporation (\u201cLockwood\u201d). The assets sold included substantially all of the Company\u2019s equipment, furniture, fixtures, and other assets located in the Idaho Falls, Idaho, facility for a total of $75,000. In addition, the Company sold inventory from the Idaho Falls operation to Lockwood for $255,000. The proceeds from these sales were used to reduce the Company\u2019s loan balance with its lender.\nOn July 25, 1997, the Company notified its creditors by mail that the Company would begin an orderly liquidation of all of its remaining assets, outside of a formal bankruptcy or receivership proceeding, in a manner intended to maximize the asset values. The Company retained the firm of Edward Hostmann, Inc. to assist the Company in such liquidation which was completed during 1997.\nPost-Liquidation Operations\nSince 1999, the Board of Directors has devoted its efforts to establishing a new business or engaging in a merger or other reorganization transaction.\nThe Company closed a private placement of 13,334 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d) on September 7, 2007. Each Unit was sold for $150 and consisted of: one share of Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock ($100 stated value) convertible into 1,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201ccommon stock\u201d); 500 shares of common stock; and 500 five-year warrants, each warrant exercisable for one share of common stock at $0.15 per share. Gross proceeds from the offering were $2,000,100, expenses of the offering were approximately $38,000, and net proceeds were approximately $1,962,000.\nThe Company is reporting that effective on December 31, 2018, the Company successfully completed a voluntary early conversion of its outstanding Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIn recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on our costs and, as described elsewhere herein, we have passed some price increases along to our customers. However, we are subject to certain market risks as described below.\nMarket risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Commodity price risk is inherent in the chemical and biofuels business both with respect to input (electricity, coal, raw materials, biofuel feedstocks, etc.) and output (manufactured chemicals and biofuels).\nWe seek to mitigate our market risks associated with the manufacturing and sale of chemicals by entering into term sale contracts that include contractual market price adjustment protections to allow changes in market prices of key raw materials to be passed on to the customer. Such price protections are not always obtained, however, so raw material price risk remains a significant risk.\nIn order to manage price risk caused by market fluctuations in biofuel prices, we may enter into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts. We account for these derivative instruments in accordance with Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Under this standard, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends upon whether it has been designated as an accounting hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. To qualify for designation as an accounting hedging relationship, specific criteria must be met and appropriate documentation maintained. We had no derivative instruments that qualified under these rules as designated accounting hedges in 2019 or 2018. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized at the end of each accounting period and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of cost of goods sold.\nOur immediate recognition of derivative instrument gains and losses can cause net income to be volatile from period to period due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel being sold. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair values of our derivative instruments were in a liability position in the amount of $267 and $297, respectively.\nOur gross profit will be impacted by the prices we pay for raw materials and conversion costs (costs incurred in the production of chemicals and biofuels) for which we do not possess contractual market price adjustment protection. These items are principally comprised of crude corn oil and yellow grease and petrodiesel. The availability and price of these items are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions, governmental policies, commodity markets, and global supply and demand.\nWe prepared a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to market risk with respect to key raw materials and conversion costs for which we do not possess contractual market price adjustment protections based on average prices in 2019. We included only those raw materials and conversion costs for which a hypothetical adverse change in price would result in a 1% or greater decrease in gross profit. Assuming that the prices of the associated finished goods could not be increased and assuming no change in quantities sold, a hypothetical 10% change in the average price of the commodities listed below would result in the following change in annual gross profit.\n(Volumes and dollars in thousands)\n(a) Volume requirements and average price information are based upon volumes used and prices obtained for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Volume requirements may differ materially from these quantities in future years as our business evolves.\nWe had no borrowings as of December 31, 2019 or 2018, and, as such, we were not exposed to interest rate risk for those years. Due to the relative insignificance of transactions denominated in a foreign currency, we consider our foreign currency risk to be immaterial.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A summarizes the market risks that the company is exposed to due to fluctuations in commodity prices.

The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe lend to our customers at a fixed rate of interest while a majority of our borrowings are at a variable rate of interest. To the extent that underlying market interest rates rise, the spread between our Loan Yield and our Cost of Funds Rate may narrow. The short duration of our loans provides us with the ability to quickly respond to a rise in underlying market interest rates by increasing the interest rates we charge our customers on new originations. Our pricing increases in 2017 and 2018 were primarily a reflection of past and expected future increases in the underlying market interest rates that we, like many other lenders in the market, are passing on to our customers. However, our ability to correspondingly increase the interest rates we charge may be limited by competitive and other factors.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an interest rate cap, which is a derivative instrument, to manage our exposure to variable interest rate movements.

In exchange for our up-front premium, we are entitled to receive variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract. The interest rate cap agreement is for a notional amount of $300 million and has a maturity date of January 2021. As of December 31, 2019, we had $572.7 million of outstanding borrowings under debt agreements with variable interest rates. Taking into account our interest rate cap, an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would result in an approximately $5.0 million net increase in our annual interest expense on our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2019. Any debt we incur in the future may also bear interest at variable rates. Any increase in interest rates in the future will likely affect our borrowing costs under all of our sources of capital for our lending activities.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nSubstantially all of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result of our Canadian operations and our growing Australia operations, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the possibility that our financial position or results of operations could be positively or negatively impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. Historically, we have not utilized derivative instruments such as forwards, options and/or swaps to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. We have expanded our use of natural hedges which match our foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities as a means to mitigate the impact of movements in exchange rates. We believe our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk will increase in the future as our foreign operations continue to grow. We will continue to explore the costs, benefits and risks of expanding our hedging program as our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk increases. We intend to enter into these transactions only to hedge underlying risk reasonably related to our business and not for speculative purposes.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A is a summary of the company's exposure to market risk, specifically interest rate sensitivity and foreign currency exchange risk.

We design, manufacture, sell and support precision power products that transform, refine, and modify the raw electrical power from the utility and convert it into various types of highly-controllable, usable power that is predictable, repeatable, and customizable. Our power solutions enable innovation in complex semiconductor and thin film plasma processes such as dry etch, strip, chemical and physical deposition, high and low voltage applications such as process control, data center computing, networking, telecommunication, analytical instrumentation, medical equipment, industrial technology and temperature-critical thermal applications such as material and chemical processing. We also supply related instrumentation products for advanced temperature measurement and control, electrostatic instrumentation products for test and measurement applications, and gas sensing and monitoring solutions for multiple industrial markets. Our network of global service support centers provides local repair and field service to our customers in key regions as well as upgrade and refurbishment services, and sales of used equipment to businesses that use our products. Our products are primarily sold into the Semiconductor Equipment, Industrial and Medical, Data Center Computing, and Telecom and Networking markets. Advanced Energy is organized on a global, functional basis and operates in a single segment structure for electrical power conversion and control products. We sell our products into four markets or applications and provide revenue data by market to enable tracking of market trends. Following the acquisition of Artesyn Embedded Technologies, Inc.\u2019s embedded power business (\"Artesyn\") in September 2019, we have also provided information on an organic and inorganic basis, which in 2020 was limited to the Artesyn acquisition, to improve comparability during the periods.\nDuring 2020, we saw the continued spread of COVID-19 which grew into a global pandemic. Our first priority was to provide a healthy and safe working environment for our employees which led to intermittent shutdowns of our manufacturing facilities to implement new health and safety protocols and make additional investments to comply with government guidelines. There were periods when some of our manufacturing facilities were not operating or were operating at reduced capacity due to government mandates to restrict travel, require social distancing and implement health and safety procedures. Many of our engineers and non-manufacturing personnel transitioned largely to a work from home environment. Additionally, the availability of materials, parts and subcomponents needed for production was also impacted during 2020. We expect the challenges associated with this environment to continue into 2021.\nAlthough COVID-19 has impacted our revenues and manufacturing efficiency over the course of 2020, COVID-19 has not materially impacted our liquidity, our ability to access capital, our ability to comply with our debt covenants or the fair value of our assets. Additionally, we believe the accommodations we have made to our work environment, including employees utilizing work-from-home arrangements where necessary, will not impact our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. While COVID-19 has not had a material adverse effect on our business during 2020, it is unknown if COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our future operations, our financial results (including, but not limited to, gross profit, and cash generation) or liquidity.

EBITDA is not a calculation provided for under GAAP; however, the amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA is presented here because it is a widely used financial indicator used by investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA is also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants.\nSet forth below is our calculation of EBITDA.\nReconciliations of refinery operating information (non-GAAP performance measures) to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements.\nRefinery gross margin and net operating margin are non-GAAP performance measures that are used by our management and others to compare our refining performance to that of other companies in our industry. We believe these margin measures are helpful to investors in evaluating our refining performance on a relative and absolute basis. Refinery gross margin per produced barrel sold is total refining segment revenues less total refining segment cost of products sold, exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments, divided by sales volumes of produced refined products sold. Net operating margin per barrel sold is the difference between refinery gross margin and refinery operating expenses per produced barrel sold. These two margins do not include the non-cash effects of long-lived asset impairment charges, lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments or depreciation and amortization. Each of these component performance measures can be reconciled directly to our consolidated statements of income. Other companies in our industry may not calculate these performance measures in the same manner.\nBelow are reconciliations to our consolidated statements of income for refinery net operating and gross margin and operating expenses, in each case averaged per produced barrel sold. Due to rounding of reported numbers, some amounts may not calculate exactly.\nTable of Content\nReconciliation of average refining segment net operating margin per produced barrel sold to refinery gross margin to total sales and other revenues\nReconciliation of average refining segment operating expenses per produced barrel sold to total operating expenses\nTable of Content\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk provides a reconciliation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, in particular changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect our interest income from portfolio investments, the fair value of our fixed income investments, and our cost of funding.\nOur interest income will be affected by changes in various interest rates, including LIBOR and prime rates, to the extent any of our debt investments include floating interest rates. We generally invest in floating rate debt instruments, meaning that the interest rate payable on such instrument resets periodically based upon changes in a specified interest rate index, typically the one-month or three-month LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 87.9% of our LMM, Private Loan, and Middle Market portfolio debt investments (based on cost) contained floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, the one-month and three-month LIBOR was approximately 1.76% and 1.91% respectively. Many of our investments provide that the specified interest rate on such instruments will never fall below a level, or floor, generally between 100 and 150 basis points, equal to 1.0% to 1.5%, regardless of the level of the specified index rate.\nIn addition, any fluctuations in prevailing interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments and result in changes in unrealized gains and losses, and may also affect a net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations. Such changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation will materialize into realized gains and losses if we sell our investments before their respective debt maturity dates.\nFurther, because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is partially dependent upon the difference between the interest rate at which we invest borrowed funds and the interest rate at which we borrow funds. In periods of rising interest rates and when we have borrowed capital with floating interest rates, our interest expense will increase, which will increase our financing costs and reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed-rate debt investments. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\nThe following table shows the approximate annualized increase or decrease (dollars in thousands) in the components of net investment income due to hypothetical interest rate index changes, assuming no changes in our investments and borrowings as of December 31, 2019.\nAlthough we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowing under the Credit Facilities or other borrowings, that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.\nIf deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A is a disclosure about the market risk that the company is exposed to due to changes in interest rates.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn July 1996, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Merck KGaA, a German corporation, Scripps Research Institute, a California nonprofit corporation, and David A. Cheresh, Ph.D., a research scientist with Scripps, seeking damages and injunctive relief. The complaint charged, among other things, that the defendant Merck KGaA willfully and deliberately induced, and continues to willfully and deliberately induce, defendants Scripps Research Institute and Dr. David A. Cheresh to infringe certain of our patents. These patents are part of a group of patents granted to The Burnham Institute and licensed by us that are based on the interaction between a family of cell surface proteins called integrins and the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (known as \"RGD\") peptide sequence found in many extracellular matrix proteins. The defendants filed a countersuit asking for an award of defendants' reasonable attorney fees. This case went to trial in February 2000, and on March 17, 2000, a jury returned a unanimous verdict for us finding that Merck KGaA had infringed and induced the infringement of our patents, and awarded $15,000,000 in damages. On September 29, 2000, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California entered judgment in our favor and against Merck KGaA in the case. In entering the judgment, the court also granted us pre-judgment interest of approximately $1,350,000, bringing the total amount to approximately $16,350,000, plus post-judgment interest. Various post-trial motions are pending, including requests by Merck KGaA for a new trial or a judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict, which could have the effect of reducing the judgment or reversing the verdict of the jury. In addition, if we win these post-trial motions, we expect Merck KGaA to appeal various decisions of the Court. No amounts for this favorable verdict have been reflected in our financial statements.\nWe are also subject to other claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business, including claims by employees or former employees and with respect to our products. In the opinion of management, such other claims are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified, and are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Broadlane has stated its belief that we have failed to provide the technology required to operate the Broadlane marketplace in the manner and within the time frame established in the technology and services agreement. Our management has had extensive discussions with Broadlane in an effort to address these concerns, and believes it is in both companies' best interest to settle this dispute quickly and amicably. We believe that any settlement of our disagreement with Broadlane will involve termination of all agreements between the parties, resulting in severance of Broadlane's customer relationship with us, and may also involve the transfer or repurchase of our common stock interest in Broadlane.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nOur exposure to the financial markets consists of changes in interest rates relative to the balance of our outstanding debt obligations and derivatives that we have employed from time to time to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates, foreign currency rate and commodity prices. We do not use financial instruments or derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risks\nThe aggregate principal amount of variable rate debt we had outstanding under our debt instruments as of December 31, 2019 was $129.5 million (as of December 31, 2018: $99.0 million). This debt had a weighted average interest rate, inclusive of designated interest rate swap contracts, of 3.58% as of December 31, 2019 (as of December 31, 2018: 4.11%). Based on the variable rate debt in our debt instruments as of December 31, 2019 including the impact of the interest rate swap contract discussed below, a change in interest rate of 1% would result in an increase or a decrease of our annual interest expense of approximately $0.8 million.\nWe have interest rate swap contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to mitigate our exposure to possible increases in interest rates. The swap contracts consist of four individual $12.5 million swaps with an aggregate notional value of $50.0 million as\nof December 31, 2019 and have various maturities through 2023. The fair value liability of these interest rate swaps were $0.9 million as of December 31, 2019.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risks\nOur sales to ANSAC are denominated in U.S. dollars but our sales to other international customers may be denominated in a foreign currency, which exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations.\nCommodity Price Risks\nEnergy costs represent a large part of our cost of products sold. Natural gas is a large component of that expense. We purchase natural gas primarily from two suppliers: BP Energy and Castleton. The purchase price we pay does not include the cost of transportation so we must arrange and pay for the cost of transporting the natural gas from the gas compressor facility approximately 20 miles from the plant to our facility. We have a separate contract for the transportation of gas. We pay a fixed amount to reserve capacity on a daily basis. In order to mitigate the risk of gas price fluctuations, we hedge a portion of our forecasted natural gas purchases by entering into physical or financial gas hedges generally ranging between 20% and 80% of our expected monthly gas requirements, on a sliding scale, for approximately the next four years. We can give no assurance that we will continue this practice. Historically, we have taken physical delivery under our physical gas contract and we intend to take physical delivery in the future. In addition, to manage our exposure to fluctuating natural gas prices, we enter into financial gas forward purchase contracts. We generally designate our financial gas forward contracts with financial counter-parties as cash flow hedges. Any outstanding contracts are valued at market with the offset going to other comprehensive income (loss), and any material hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in cost of goods sold. Any gain or loss is recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The aggregate notional value of our financial gas forward purchase contracts as of December 31, 2019 was $31.2 million and net fair value liability was $5.0 million.

We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest rates\nOur earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from variable interest rate borrowings. At December 31, 2020, we had $21.4 million in variable-rate debt, of which $6.4 million was not subject to interest rate swap agreements. A hypothetical interest rate change of 10% would not have a material impact on annualized interest expense.\nForeign exchange rates\nBecause we conduct our operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies, our results of operations as expressed in U.S. dollars may be significantly affected by fluctuations in rates of exchange between currencies. These fluctuations could be significant. In 2020, approximately 50.6% of our net sales and a significant portion of our costs were denominated in currencies other than the dollar. We generally are unable to adjust our non-dollar local currency sales prices to reflect changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the relevant local currency. As a result, changes in exchange rates between the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, South Korean won or other currencies in which we receive sale proceeds and the dollar have a direct impact on our operating results. There is normally a time lag between our sales and collection of the related sales proceeds, exposing us to additional currency exchange rate risk.\nWhen practicable, we endeavor to match assets and liabilities in the same currency on our U.S. balance sheet and those of our subsidiaries in order to reduce these risks. We also, when we consider it appropriate, enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge exposures arising from those transactions.\nAt December 31, 2020, a hypothetical change of 10% in foreign currency exchange rates would cause a change in revenue of approximately $24.1 million, assuming all other variables remained constant.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies. At December 31, 2020, we had notional forward exchange contracts outstanding of $101.8 million. We believe these foreign currency forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk.\nCommodity prices\nWe are exposed to price volatility related to raw materials and energy products in conjunction with our printer assembly and print materials blending processes. Generally, we acquire such components at market prices and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. At December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 10% change in commodity prices for raw materials would cause a change to cost of sales of approximately $5.1 million.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.

FaceBank\u2019s position is that the pro se Complaint is defamatory, without merit in fact or law and represents an extortive attempt to coerce payment under threat of reputational harm. FaceBank\u2019s subsidiaries and affiliates filed a motion to dismiss on September 25, 2018. On July 24, 2019, all counts of the complaint were dismissed in favor of FaceBank\u2019s subsidiaries and affiliates. Mr. Meide was afforded the opportunity to file an amended complaint for a portion of his claims, and such amendment was filed on September 24, 2019. On October 6, 2019, Judge Marcia Morales Howard ordered Mr. Meide\u2019s amended complaint stricken, describing the filing as insufficient and having failed to identify facts necessary to support its allegations, and offering Mr. Meide \u201cone final opportunity to properly state his claims\u201d with an amended complaint. Mr. Meide\u2019s third attempt to submit a sufficient complaint was filed on November 1, 2019. On November 22, 2019 FaceBank\u2019s subsidiaries and affiliates filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On December 31, 2019 Mr. Meide filed an opposition to the motions to dismiss. On January 9, 2020, the court struck Mr. Meide\u2019s opposition and on February 3, 2020 issued an order requiring Mr. Meide to show cause why the case should not be dismissed. Mr. Meide was given until March 6, 2020 to respond to the motions to dismiss filed by FaceBank\u2019s subsidiaries and affiliates. Mr. Meide\u2019s apparent final opportunity to oppose the defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss was filed on March 2, 2020. FaceBank believes Mr. Meide\u2019s most recent filing is a near carbon copy of prior arguments and filings that have either been dismissed or were stricken and that Mr. Meide\u2019s final amended complaint will be dismissed. FaceBank plans to the ask the court for an award of sanctions and attorney fees in connection with Mr. Meide\u2019s filing of a frivolous lawsuit.\nOn June 25, 2018, prior to our acquisition of a majority interest in PEC, an office space vendor filed a complaint against such company (Case#: CIV1802192) in the Superior Court of the State of California, Marin County asserting breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation. The Company\u2019s subsidiary then responded with affirmative defenses on September 27, 2018.

Insignia Financial Group, Inc., et al. in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo. The plaintiffs named as defendants, among others, the Partnership, its General Partner and several of their affiliated partnerships and corporate entities. The action purports to assert claims on behalf of a class of limited partners and derivatively on behalf of a number of limited partnerships (including the Partnership) which are named as nominal defendants, challenging, among other things, the acquisition of interests in certain general partner entities by Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (\"Insignia\") and entities which were, at one time, affiliates of Insignia; past tender offers by the Insignia affiliates to acquire limited partnership units; management of the partnerships by the Insignia affiliates; and the Insignia Merger. The plaintiffs seek monetary damages and equitable relief, including judicial dissolution of the Partnership. On June 25, 1998, the General Partner filed a motion seeking dismissal of the action. In lieu of responding to the motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The General Partner filed demurrers to the amended complaint which were heard February 1999.\nPending the ruling on such demurrers, settlement negotiations commenced. On November 2, 1999, the parties executed and filed a Stipulation of Settlement, settling claims, subject to court approval, on behalf of the Partnership and all limited partners who owned units as of November 3, 1999. Preliminary approval of the settlement was obtained on November 3, 1999 from the Court, at which time the Court set a final approval hearing for December 10, 1999. Prior to the December 10, 1999 hearing, the Court received various objections to the settlement, including a challenge to the Court's preliminary approval based upon the alleged lack of authority of prior lead counsel to enter the settlement. On December 14, 1999, the General Partner and its affiliates terminated the proposed settlement. In February 2000, counsel for some of the named plaintiffs filed a motion to disqualify plaintiff's lead and liaison counsel who negotiated the settlement. On June 27, 2000, the Court entered an order disqualifying them from the case and an appeal was taken from the order on October 5, 2000.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates. We do not have exposure to any other significant market risk. We monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations. Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates, primarily in short-term LIBOR and the SIFMA index as a result of borrowings under our Credit Facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates. In addition, the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates. The effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results, such as rental rates and occupancy.\nWe currently use interest rate protection agreements (consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements) for our risk management objectives, as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders, and not for trading or speculative purposes. During 2019, we settled an aggregate of $250,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2018 in conjunction with the May 2019 unsecured note issuance. During 2019, we entered into $350,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2020, which are outstanding as of December 31, 2019. In February 2020, in conjunction with the pricing of the $700,000,000 principal amount of 2.30% unsecured notes due in 2030, we settled $350,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements.\nIn addition, we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing. Further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $1,026,150,000 and $1,169,140,000, respectively, in variable rate debt outstanding, with no amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility. If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2019 and 2018, our annual interest incurred would have increased by approximately $11,221,000 and $14,963,000, respectively, based on balances outstanding during the applicable years.\nBecause the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an A or better credit rating by the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes, considering our current market yields, which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness. Debt securities and notes payable (including amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility) with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $7,355,371,000 at December 31, 2019 had an estimated aggregate fair value of $7,595,918,000 at December 31, 2019. Contractual fixed rate debt represented $6,675,131,000 of the fair value at December 31, 2019. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of December 31, 2019, the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately $720,500,000.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe company is exposed to market risks primarily from changes in market interest rates.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nThe Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. Where possible, the Company nets certain of these exposures to take advantage of natural offsets. For certain remaining exposures, the Company may enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to the Company\u2019s hedging policies. The financial impacts of these hedging instruments are offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged.\nIndex\nThe Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Note 1 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements include discussions of the Company\u2019s accounting policies for financial instruments.\nBecause the Company manufactures and sells its products throughout the world, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The major foreign currency exposures include the markets in Western Europe, Latin America, Canada, and Asia. The primary purpose of the Company\u2019s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency sales, purchases of materials, and other assets and liabilities created during the normal course of business. The Company generally utilizes foreign exchange contracts with durations of less than 18 months that may or may not be designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The net fair value of these instruments, based on dealer quotes, was a liability of $0.2 million and an asset of $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of the Company\u2019s outstanding foreign exchange contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts, would be approximately $1.4 million.

In addition, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company has certain debt denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, and British Pounds. These non-derivative debt instruments act as partial hedges of the Company\u2019s Euro, Swiss Franc, and British Pound net asset positions. The potential increase or decrease in the annual U.S. dollar equivalent interest expense of the Company\u2019s outstanding foreign currency-denominated debt, assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in the currencies of such debt, would be approximately $0.7 million at December 31, 2019. However, any change in interest expense from fluctuations in currency, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the foreign income before interest. In addition, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company manages its debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate and floating rate debt.

At December 31, 2019, the potential increase or decrease in annual interest expense of floating rate debt, assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in interest rates, would be approximately $0.5 million.\nThe Company is the purchaser of certain commodities, such as vanilla, corn, sugar, soybean meal, and fruits. The Company generally purchases these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process. In general, the Company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices due to a high correlation between the commodity cost and the ultimate selling price of the Company\u2019s products.

Euclid Medical and Office Building was one of those properties for which the Company so advanced funds. The suit seeks reimbursement for the funds advanced by the Company for the benefit of this property. Metro City No. 1 made a capital call to its partners requesting funds to pay this obligation. The Chairman of the Board, his wife and brothers-in-law have paid the Company their proportionate share of the capital call; however, the remaining non-affiliated partners of Metro City No. 1 have refused to do so. The Company believes the recorded amount of the receivable is stated at its net realizable value.\n\tA lawsuit is pending in the Harris County, Texas district court against MIG Realty Advisors, Inc. (MIG's predecessor company) involving a claim for contribution and indemnity arising out of MIG Realty Advisors, Inc. having served as an investment advisor to an advisory client in connection with the acquisition of an apartment project located in Houston, Texas. On or about December 30, 1998, the advisory client that acquired the property filed suit against the seller, the consulting engineer who performed the engineering due diligence and others seeking damages for defective conditions discovered at the property that were allegedly concealed by the seller and not discovered by the consulting engineer during the pre-purchase due diligence investigation conducted by the engineer. The consulting engineer filed a third party claim against MIG Realty Advisors, Inc., alleging that MIG Realty Advisors, Inc. was responsible for the conduct of the due diligence investigation and consequently MIG Realty Advisors, Inc., rather than the engineer was responsible for any damages suffered by the advisory client. The third party complaint does not specify the amount of damages being claimed, but rather seeks contribution and indemnity for any judgment rendered against the consulting engineer arising out of the complaint against it filed by the advisory client. However, these potential claims may be approximately $9.0 million. The Company is vigorously defending against the claims brought by the consulting engineer in the third party complaint and cannot predict the final outcome of this dispute.\nItem 4.", "summary": "A lawsuit is pending in Cuyahoga County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas against Euclid Medical and Commercial Arts, an Ohio limited partnership and its general partner, Metro City No. 1, an Ohio general partnership, seeking damages in excess of $729,000.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe discussion below about our risk management strategies includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Management\u2019s projections of hypothetical net losses in the fair values of our market rate-sensitive financial instruments, should certain potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. While we believe that the potential market rate changes are possible, actual rate changes could differ from our projections. Although we are exposed to a currency exchange rate risk for our foreign operations, this risk is not material to Stewart\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe material market risk in our investments in financial instruments is related to our debt securities portfolio. We invest primarily in municipal, corporate, foreign and U.S. Government debt securities. At December 31, 2019, our investments in equity securities represented approximately 6% of our total securities investments, with the remainder invested in debt securities. We do not invest in financial instruments of a derivative or hedging nature.\nWe have established policies and procedures to minimize our exposure to changes in the fair values of our investments. These policies include retaining an investment advisory firm, an emphasis upon credit quality, management of portfolio duration, maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing our risk profile and security mix depending upon market conditions. We have classified all of our debt securities investments as available-for-sale.\nInvestments in debt securities at December 31, 2019 mature, according to their contractual terms, as follows (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights):\nWe believe our investment portfolios are diversified and do not expect any material loss to result from the failure to perform by issuers of the debt securities we hold. Our investments are not collateralized. Foreign debt securities primarily include Canadian government and corporate bonds with aggregate fair values of $206.5 million and $171.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Also included in foreign debt securities are United Kingdom treasury and corporate bonds with aggregate fair values of $24.1 million and $23.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nBased on our foreign debt securities portfolio and foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2019, a 100 basis-point increase (decrease) in foreign currency exchange rates would result in an increase (decrease) of approximately $2.3 million in the fair value of our foreign debt securities portfolio. We do not currently employ hedging strategies with respect to foreign currency risk as we do not consider this risk as material to the Company. In addition, our international businesses conduct substantially all of their operations in their respective local currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the fair value of the debt securities portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses.\nBased on our debt securities portfolio and interest rates at December 31, 2019, a 100 basis-point increase (decrease) in interest rates would result in a decrease (increase) of approximately $21.5 million, or 3.6%, in the fair value of our portfolio. Changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the debt securities portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses.\nUnrealized gains or losses on investments from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates would only be realized upon the sale of such investments. Fair value changes relating to equity securities and other-than-temporary declines in fair values of debt securities are charged to operations.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Stewart Inc. has established policies and procedures to minimize its exposure to changes in the fair values of its investments in debt securities.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIndebtedness\nWe expect that our primary market risk exposure will be interest rate risk with respect to our indebtedness and credit risk and market risk with respect to use of derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal balance of our variable rate indebtedness was $159.4 million and consisted of three mortgage loans.\nOur mortgage loans are variable rate and indexed to the one-month and daily U.S. Dollar denominated LIBOR. For the year ended December 31, 2019, a 10% increase in one-month and daily U.S. Dollar denominated LIBOR would have resulted in increased interest expense of $0.1 million.\nInvestment in real estate-related loans\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held $50 million of investments in two real estate-related loans. Our investments are floating-rate and indexed to one-month U.S. denominated LIBOR and as such, exposed to interest rate risk. Our net income will increase or decrease depending on interest rate movements. While we cannot predict factors which may or may not affect interest rates, for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 10% increase or decrease in the one-month U.S. denominated LIBOR rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease to income from our real estate-related loans of $0.04 million.\nWe may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to maintain liquidity, fund capital expenditures and expand our investment portfolio and operations. Market fluctuations in real estate financing may affect the availability and cost of funds needed to expand our investment portfolio. In addition, restrictions upon the availability of real estate financing or high interest rates for real estate loans could adversely affect our ability to dispose of real estate in the future. We will seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our assets.\nCredit risk includes the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of a derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We will seek to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties.\nMarket risk includes the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The market risk associated with interest-rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. With regard to variable rate financing, we assess our interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. We maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both our outstanding and forecasted debt obligations as well as our potential offsetting hedge positions. While this hedging strategy is designed to minimize the impact on our net income and funds from operations from changes in interest rates, the overall returns on your investment may be reduced.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe company is exposed to market risk primarily through its indebtedness and investments in real estate-related loans. These loans are variable rate and indexed to the one-month and daily U.S. Dollar denominated LIBOR, meaning that a 10% increase or decrease in the LIBOR rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease to income of $0.1 million and $0.04 million respectively.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities. Our investments are fixed-rate short-term and long-term securities. Fixed-rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, and, as a result, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $318.2 million invested in available-for-sale marketable securities. An immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows.\nWe do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Based on interest bearing liabilities we have as of December 31, 2019, we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases.\nCurrency Rate Risk\nAs a result of our international business activities, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets, and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future. We generally sell our products in the local currency of the respective countries. This provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries\u2019 operating expenses are generally denominated in their local currencies. Regardless of this natural hedging, our results of operations may be adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The gains and losses on these forward contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being economically hedged. These instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally are one month in original maturity. We do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates. It is difficult to predict the impact forward contracts could have on our results of operations. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was not material.\nAlthough we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations, and, where appropriate, may use forward contracts to minimize the effect of these fluctuations, the impact of an aggregate change of 10% in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

Legal Proceedings.\nThe Company is currently involved in litigation as follows:\n\u25cf In October 2012 the State of Texas filed a lawsuit naming Infinity-Texas, the Company and the corporate officers of Infinity-Texas, seeking $30,000 of reclamation costs associated with a single well, in addition to administrative expenses and penalties. The Company engaged in negotiations with the State of Texas in late 2012 and early 2013 and reached a settlement agreement that would reduce the aggregate liability, in this action and any extension of this to other Texas wells, to $45,103, which amount has been paid. Certain performance obligations remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss the matter.\nPending satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the State of Texas, the officers have potential liability regarding the above matter, and the officers are held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the Company. Therefore, to the extent they might occur, these liabilities are the obligations of the Company. Management estimates that the liabilities associated with this matter will not exceed $780,000, calculated as $30,000 for each of the 26 Infinity-Texas operated wells. This related liability, less the payment made to the State of Texas in 2012 in the amount of $45,103, is included in the asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets.\n\u25cf Cambrian Consultants America, Inc.

Cambrian provided these services pursuant to a Master Consulting Agreement with Infinity, dated November 20, 2013, and has claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts due. On December 8, 2014, a default judgment was entered against the Company in the amount of $96,877 plus interest and attorney fees. The Company has included the impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable. The Company will seek to settle the default judgment when it has the financial resources to do so.\n\u25cf Torrey Hills Capital, Inc.

The parties entered into a consulting agreement under which Torrey agreed to provide investor relations services in exchange for payment of $7,000 per month and the issuance of 15,000 shares of common stock. The agreement was for an initial three month-term with automatic renewals unless terminated upon 30 days\u2019 written notice by either party. The Company made payments totaling $14,000 and issued 15,000 shares of common stock during 2013.

Torrey disputed the Company\u2019s contentions and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. The Company was unable to defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded Torrey a total of $79,594 in damages.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company is exposed to certain market risks that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes. A discussion of the Company\u2019s primary market risk exposure and interest rate risk is presented below.\nDebt and Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt, including its revolving credit facility and term loan facility. Assuming no changes in the Company\u2019s capital structure, if market interest rates average 1% more over the next 12 months than the interest rates as of December 29, 2019, interest expense for the next 12 months would increase by approximately $2.1 million. This amount was determined by calculating the effect of the hypothetical interest rate on the unhedged portion of the Company\u2019s variable rate debt. This calculated, hypothetical increase in interest expense for the following 12 months may be different from the actual increase in interest expense from a 1% increase in interest rates due to varying interest rate reset dates on the Company\u2019s variable rate debt.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition related contingent consideration, which is adjusted to fair value each reporting period, is also impacted by changes in interest rates. The risk-free interest rate used to estimate the Company\u2019s WACC is a component of the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future cash flows due under the Company\u2019s comprehensive beverage agreement. As a result, any changes in the underlying risk-free interest rates will impact the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.\nRaw Material and Commodity Prices\nThe Company is also subject to commodity price risk arising from price movements for certain commodities included as part of its raw materials. The Company manages this commodity price risk in some cases by entering into contracts with adjustable prices to hedge commodity purchases. The Company periodically uses derivative commodity instruments in the management of this risk. The Company estimates a 10% increase in the market prices of commodities included as part of its raw materials over the current market prices would cumulatively increase costs during the next 12 months by approximately $58.2 million assuming no change in volume.\nFees paid by the Company for agreements to hedge commodity purchases are amortized over the corresponding period of the instruments. The Company accounts for commodity hedges on a mark-to-market basis with any expense or income being reflected as an adjustment to cost of sales or SD&A expenses.\nEffect of Changing Prices\nThe annual rate of inflation in the United States, as measured by year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index (the \u201cCPI\u201d), was 2.3% in 2019 and 2.4% in 2018. Inflation in the prices of those commodities important to the Company\u2019s business is reflected in changes in the CPI, but commodity prices are volatile and in recent years have moved at a faster rate of change than the CPI.\nThe principal effect of inflation in both commodity and consumer prices on the Company\u2019s operating results is to increase costs, both of goods sold and SD&A expenses. Although the Company can offset these cost increases by increasing selling prices for its products, consumers may not have the buying power to cover these increased costs and may reduce their volume of purchases of those products. In that event, selling price increases may not be sufficient to offset completely the Company\u2019s cost increases.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text provides an overview of the market risks that the Company is exposed to.

We are exposed to market risk from changes in the interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding debt. Outstanding revolving balances under our credit agreements bear interest at variable rates based on a margin over defined LIBOR, the Bank of England Base Rate, or the Australian Bank Bill Swap Rate. Based on the amount outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2019, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $2.5 million change to our annual other interest expense. Similarly, amounts outstanding under floor plan financing arrangements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over the prime rate, defined LIBOR, the Finance House Base Rate, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, the Canadian Prime Rate, the Australian Bank Bill Swap Rate, or the New Zealand Bank Bill Benchmark Rate.\nBased on an average of the aggregate amounts outstanding under our floor plan financing arrangements subject to variable interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2019, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $37.4 million change to our annual floor plan interest expense.\nWe evaluate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and follow established policies and procedures to implement strategies designed to manage the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding at any point in time in an effort to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows. These policies include:\n\u25cfthe maintenance of our overall debt portfolio with targeted fixed and variable rate components;\n\u25cfthe use of authorized derivative instruments;\n\u25cfthe prohibition of using derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes; and\n\u25cfthe prohibition of highly leveraged derivatives or derivatives which we are unable to reliably value, or for which we are unable to obtain a market quotation.\nInterest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value of our fixed rate debt, mortgages, and certain seller financed promissory notes, but, with respect to such fixed rate debt instruments, do not impact our earnings or cash flows.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had consolidated operations in the U.K., Germany, Italy, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In each of these markets, the local currency is the functional currency. In the event we change our intent with respect to the investment in any of our international operations, we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows.

Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility could materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. For additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part II - Other information, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvestment valuation risk\nBecause there is not a readily available market value for some of the investments in our portfolio, we value those portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors based on, among other things, the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the management of our invested companies to assist in the valuation a portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

Because we do not fund any of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is not affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d was adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-09, where applicable. No further adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2017 have been made in this Annual Report.\nWe are exposed to the impact of both interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations.\nInterest Rate Risk. We face exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relating to our investments. We generally invest our excess cash in short-term, highly-rated, fixed-rate financial instruments. These fixed-rate instruments are subject to interest rate risk and may fall in value if interest rates increase. We do not hold or invest in these fixed-rate instruments for trading purposes or speculation. As of December 31, 2019, we held approximately $108.9 million of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with stated maturity dates between three months and one year from the purchase date.\nForeign Currency Risk. We conduct a significant portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the currency in which we report our Consolidated Financial Statements. International revenues accounted for 43.7%, 42.3%, and 41.8% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We anticipate that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. The functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency.\nAssets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable Balance Sheet date and any resulting translation adjustments are included as an adjustment to stockholders\u2019 equity. Revenues and expenses generated from these subsidiaries are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the quarter in which the transactions occur. Gains and losses from transactions in local currencies are included in net income.\nAs a result of transacting in multiple currencies and reporting our Consolidated Financial Statements in U.S. dollars, our operating results may be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future.

{"section": "ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Corporation's primary market risks are commodity price risk and interest rate risk. Exposure to commodity price risk related to its purchases and/or sales of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, power supplies and petroleum products is mitigated in several different ways. Depending on market conditions, Central Hudson and CH Services enter into long-term fixed supply and long-term forward supply contracts for the purchase and/or sale of these commodities. Central Hudson also uses storage gas facilities to purchase blocks of natural gas at preheating season prices for use during the heating season. The Corporation also enters into derivative transactions to hedge market price fluctuations.\nThe Corporation has in place an energy risk management program whose primary goal is to further manage, through the use of defined risk management practices, price risk associated with commodity purchases in its operations. The Corporation's written policy and procedures for this program permit the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge price risk but prohibit their use for speculative purposes. Both Central Hudson and CH Services have entered into either exchange-traded futures contracts and over-the-counter contracts with third parties to hedge commodity price risk associated with the purchase and/or sale of natural gas, electricity and petroleum products. Central Hudson has entered into derivative contracts to hedge a small portion of its total gas supply requirements as well as some purchased electric and electric sales for resale transactions. The fair value of open positions at December 31, 2000, as well as the resultant net transaction gains related to derivative transactions, were not material to the Corporation's financial position or results of operation. CH Services has entered into derivative transactions to hedge the purchase and sale of electricity and the value of oil inventories. Open positions at December 31, 2000 reflected a reduction in fair value of $3.2 million, and an actual net gain approximating $3.0 million was realized in 2000 for settled derivatives which offset the change in the expected price of the commodity sold or purchased. Derivative transactions occurring in 1999 were not material to the Corporation's financial position or results of operation. All hedge transactions were accounted for under the deferral method (SFAS 80, \"Accounting for Futures Contracts\") with gains and losses from the hedging activity included in either the cost of the commodity or as an adjustment to revenues.\nCentral Hudson's exposure to commodity price risk related to its purchases of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, and other power sales is also mitigated by its electric and gas cost adjustment clauses. These adjustment clauses provide for the return or collection of costs, including risk management costs, to or from customers for costs below or in excess of base costs included in rates charged to customers. Risk management costs are defined by the PSC as \"costs associated with transactions that are intended to reduce price volatility or reduce overall costs to customers. These costs include transaction costs, and gains and losses associated with other risk management entities.\" Variations in Central Hudson electric fuel costs are also subject to a fuel cost incentive mechanism with an annual exposure of up to $3.0 million in either additional revenues or costs.\nCentral Hudson manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through economic refunding of debt through optional refundings. A portion of Central Hudson's long-term debt consists of variable rate debt for which interest is reset on a periodic basis reflecting current market conditions. The difference between costs associated with actual variable interest rates and costs embedded in customer rates is deferred for eventual passback or recovery to or from customers. CH Services had no long-term debt during 2000 or 1999.\nITEM 8", "summary": "A - SUMMARY\nCentral Hudson and CH Services manage their market risk by entering into long-term fixed supply and long-term forward supply contracts, using storage gas facilities, and entering into derivative transactions.

{"section": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nResults of Operations\nGolden Royal was organized in November 2016, but did not commence operations until September 2018, when it acquired equity in certain oil and gas properties in Fremont County and Converse County, Wyoming. Then in December 2018 Golden Royal acquired ownership of precious metal rights in a parcel of land in Crooks County, Wyoming. All of these properties were acquired from Jacob Roth, who owns 95% of Golden Royal\u2019s outstanding shares.\nThere are no mining operations taking place on any of the three properties; accordingly we recorded no revenue for either the year ended September 30, 2019 or the year ended September 30, 2018. We do not expect to record revenue unless (a) we resell one of our properties, (b) we receive payment by reason of the overriding royalty in Converse County or some similar property that we acquire in the future, or (c) we acquire sufficient cash recourses to permit us to participate in a drilling or mining project that yields revenue.\nThe operating expenses that we incurred - $71,063 during the year ended September 30, 2019 and $10,618 during the year ended September 30, 2018 - were attributable to the costs of sustaining Golden Royal\u2019s initial administrative operations (including registration of the common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the three months ended March 31, 2019) and securing its initial financing. In addition, we incurred interest expense of $2,346 and $534 for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, because we imputed interest on the funds that Jacob Roth has loaned to Golden Royal to sustain its operations. Mr. Roth contributed the accrued interest to the capital of the Company.\nBy reason of the expenses described above, Golden Royal incurred a net loss of $73,409 in the year ended September 30, 2019 and a net loss of $11,152 in the year ended September 30, 2018. We will continue to incur net losses until we initiate revenue-producing operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur operations used $29,551 in cash during the year ended September 30, 2019, and $12,942 in cash during the year ended September 30, 2018. Our use of cash during the current fiscal year was less than our net loss primarily because we increased our accounts payable and amortized prepaid expenses. During the year ended September 30, 2018, our use of cash exceeded our net loss because we increased our prepaid expenses.\nIn both years, the cash used in operations was provided primarily by loans from Jacob Roth, which were supplemented during the year ended September 30, 2018 by a total of $960 raised through the sale of 9,600 shares of Golden Royal common stock.\nAt September 30, 2019, we had a working capital deficit of $74,664, an increase of $66,263 during fiscal year 2019.\nIn order for us to initiate participation in mineral exploration projects, we estimate that we will require approximately $2.5 million in capital. We plan to obtain that capital by issuing equity securities, either capital stock or convertible debt. To date, however, we have received no commitments for funds. Accordingly, the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our fiscal 2019 and 2018 financial statements states that there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. That doubt will be alleviated only when we obtain the funds necessary to initiate profitable operations.\nItem 7a", "summary": "of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Golden Royal's financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 reveals that the company has not recorded any revenue and has incurred net losses of $73,409 and $11,152 respectively. Operating expenses were incurred to sustain initial administrative operations and secure initial financing. Cash used in operations was provided primarily by loans from Jacob Roth, supplemented by the sale of 9,600 shares of common stock.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nCommodity Price Risk\nOil cost accounts for approximately 66.1% of our total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. We are primarily exposed to oil price volatility caused by supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We purchase oil used by our vessels at prevailing market prices. We do not have formal long-term purchase contracts with our suppliers and, therefore, we are exposed to the risk of fluctuating oil prices.\nWe did not have any commodity price derivatives or hedging arrangements outstanding at December 31, 2019 and did not employ any commodity price derivatives in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nWhile our reporting currency is the USD, all of our consolidated revenue and consolidated cost of revenue and a significant portion of our consolidated expenses are denominated in RMB. Furthermore, a significant portion of our assets are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenue and result of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between USD and RMB.\nThe value of the RMB against the USD and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. Since July 2005, the RMB has not been pegged to the USD. Although the People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the USD in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nIf the RMB depreciates against the USD, the value of our RMB revenue, earnings and assets as expressed in our USD financial statements will decline. A 1% average appreciation (depreciation) of the RMB against the USD would decrease (increase) our comprehensive income by $35,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 based on our revenue, costs and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in RMB as of December 31, 2019. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all.\nInterest rate risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk arising from short-term and long-term variable rate borrowings from time to time. Our future interest expense will fluctuate in line with any change in our borrowing rates. Our bank borrowings amounted to $227.4 million at December 31, 2019. Based on the variable nature of the underlying interest rate, the bank borrowings approximated fair value at that date.\nA hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would impact our interest on our borrowings by approximately $60,550. The potential change in interest amount is calculated based on the change in the interest amount over a one year period due to an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates.\nInflation risk\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks faced by a company, including commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, and inflation risk. The company does not have any formal long-term purchase contracts with suppliers, and does not employ any commodity price derivatives or hedging arrangements. A significant portion of the company's revenue, cost of revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities are denominated in RMB, making it exposed to foreign exchange risk. The company also has short-term and long-term variable rate borrowings, and is exposed to inflation risk."}
{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur exposure to market risks includes, but is not limited to, the following risks: changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, provisional sales contract risks, changes in interest rates, and equity price risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk; however, we may consider such arrangements in the future as we evaluate our business and financial strategy.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe results of our operations depend in large part upon the market prices of gold, silver, and base metal prices of copper, lead and zinc. Gold and silver prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. The level of interest rates, the rate of inflation, the state of the global or national economies, the stability of exchange rates, the world supply of and demand for gold, silver and other metals, among other factors, can all cause significant fluctuations in commodity prices. Such external economic factors are in turn influenced by changes in international investment patterns, monetary systems and political developments. The price of gold and silver has fluctuated widely in recent years, and future price declines could cause a mineral project to become uneconomic, thereby having a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have not entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for gold or silver. We may in the future more actively manage our exposure through derivative contracts or other commodity price risk management programs, although we have no intention of doing so in the near-term.\nIn addition to adversely affecting our reserve estimates, results of operations and/or our financial condition, declining gold and silver prices could require a reassessment of the feasibility of a project. Even if a project is ultimately determined to be economically viable, the need to conduct such a reassessment may cause delays in the implementation of a project.\nForeign Currency Risk\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations can increase or decrease our costs to the extent we pay costs in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by Mexican peso rate changes relative to the U.S. Dollar, as we incur some costs in the Mexican peso. When the value of the peso rises in relation to the U.S. Dollar, some of our costs in Mexico may increase, thus affecting our operating results. Alternatively, when the value of the peso drops\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nin relation to the U.S. Dollar, peso-denominated costs in Mexico will decrease in U.S. Dollar terms. These fluctuations do not impact our revenues since we sell our metals in U.S. dollars. Future fluctuations may give rise to foreign currency exposure, which may affect our financial results.\nWe have not utilized market-risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nProvisional Sales Contract Risk\nWe enter into concentrate sales contracts which, in general, provide for a provisional payment to us based upon provisional assays and prices. The provisionally priced sales contracts contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of concentrates determined at the quoted metal prices at the time of shipment. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is adjusted to market through revenue each period prior to settlement. Changes in the prices of metals between the shipment and final settlement date will result in adjustments to revenues related to the sales of concentrate previously recorded upon shipment. Please see Note 14 in Item 8.", "summary": "\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion of our provisional sales contracts.\nThis is a summary of the text discussing the market risks faced by a company.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAt December 31, 2019, the primary component of our market risk was interest rate risk, as described below. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we do seek to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience, to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify assuming that risk and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risk we undertake or to which we are exposed.\nEffect on Fair Value\nA component of interest rate risk is the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the fair value of our assets. We face the risk that the fair value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities, including our hedging instruments.\nWe primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities. Duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change. We generally calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data. Different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same securities.\n(Back to Index)\n(Back to Index)\nThe following sensitivity analysis table presents, at December 31, 2019, the estimated impact on the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments, instruments and liabilities of changes in interest rates, assuming rates instantaneously fall 100 basis points and rise 100 basis points (dollars in thousands):\nFor purposes of the table, we have excluded our investments and liabilities with variable interest rates that are indexed to LIBOR. Because the variable rates on these instruments are short-term in nature, we are not subject to material exposure from movements in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates.\nIt is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change beyond 100 basis points from current levels. Therefore, the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond 100 basis points from current levels. In addition, other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investment securities and hedging instruments, such as the shape of the yield curve, market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions. Accordingly, in the event of changes in actual interest rates, the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders.\nRisk Management\nTo the extent consistent with maintaining our status as a REIT, we seek to manage our interest rate risk exposure to protect our variable rate debt against the effects of major interest rate changes. We generally seek to manage our interest rate risk by:\n\u2022\nmonitoring and adjusting, if necessary, the reset index and interest rate related to our borrowings;\n\u2022\nattempting to structure our borrowing agreements for our commercial mortgage-backed securities to have a range of different maturities, terms, amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods; and\n\u2022\nusing derivatives to adjust the interest rate-sensitivity of our variable rate borrowings, which we discuss in \u201cItem 7.

GTT exercised its extension right, in accordance with the terms of its License and its agreement with the Government of Guyana, in November 2009.\nIn 2016, the Government of Guyana passed new telecommunications legislation introducing material changes to many features of Guyana\u2019s existing telecommunications regulatory regime with the intention of introducing additional competition into Guyana\u2019s telecommunications sector. The legislation that passed, however, has not yet been implemented and does not include a provision that permits other telecommunications carriers to receive licenses automatically upon signing of the legislation, nor does it have the effect of terminating the Company\u2019s exclusive license. Instead the legislation as passed requires the Minister of Telecommunications to conduct further proceedings and issue implementing orders to enact the various provisions of the legislation. We have met with the Government of Guyana, including as recently as January 2019 to discuss modifications of the Company\u2019s exclusivity rights and other rights under its existing agreement and license.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $14 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2019, $9 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.\nThe fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, $33 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $39 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.\nWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.\nThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.\nWe have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Global\u2019s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Global\u2019s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income.\nAn appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $600 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks.

{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS -----------------\nThe Company is the subject of certain legal matters which it considers incidental to its business activities. It is the opinion of management, after consultation with independent legal counsel, that the ultimate disposition of these legal matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the Company. The following claims, if determined adversely to the Company, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nePayment Solutions (\"EPS\") was a processing client of DataBank. Unbeknownst to present management of the Company, various non-EPS owned merchants were sending credit card payments to EPS, who in turn processed the transactions with the Company under the EPS name. EPS in turn was supposed to take its settlement funds and disburse them to its various merchants. The Company began seeing large chargebacks in EPS's account and therefore larger reserves were withheld in the EPS account to cover expected chargebacks. As of November 27, 2000, reserves held for EPS totaled approximately $5 million. The Company believes that adequate reserves are being held for all remaining chargebacks.\nOn November 15, 2000, the Company received a letter from an attorney representing EPS demanding payment of approximately $11 million which he claimed is an amount withheld from EPS. The Company does not believe that there is any validity to EPS's claim because all funds held are being held in reserve for chargebacks and the amounts are reasonable based upon the chargebacks that have been experienced to date.\nTwo additional merchants have made claims of approximately $600,000 to the Company regarding amounts they believe are owed them due to processing errors. The Company is working with these merchants to reconcile activity and resolve differences. Management believes that any amount ultimately owed these merchants will not be materially different than amounts currently recorded.\nThe Company processed a limited number of transactions through the Bank of Nevis, located in the British West Indies (\"the Bank\") during fiscal 2000. DataBank, acquired by the Company in October 1999, processed through the Bank prior to the acquisition. In February 2000, the Bank informed the Company that unspecified amounts were due the Bank for periods before and after the DataBank acquisition due to processing errors. The Company responded that, in fact, it believes the Bank owes the Company certain amounts that were never settled after the Company ceased processing. The Bank engaged an audit firm to analyze the matter and that audit continues today. The Bank claims the Company owes it $581,000 for the period prior to the DataBank acquisition and $500,000 for the period after the acquisition. The Company believes that the $581,000 was incorrectly overpaid by the Bank to various merchants and that it is the obligation of the Bank to recover these amounts from those merchants. The Company is liable for any unrecovered overpayments as DataBank's liabilities were assumed by the Company in the acquisition. During fiscal 2000, the Company increased the liabilities assumed in the DataBank transaction by $581,000 and increased acquired goodwill by the same amount. The Company believes the Bank's claim regarding the $500,000 for the period after the acquisition is erroneous as it includes one merchant that was never a client of DataBank or the Company and another merchant whose payments to the Bank have not been considered in the audit. The Company wrote off a receivable due from the Bank of $255,531 in fiscal 2000. Management will continue to work with the Bank and their auditors and believes the issues with the Bank will be settled during fiscal 2001 and that no material adverse impact will result.\nThe Company has been advised by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission that it is conducting an informal review of the facts underlying the Internal Investigation. The Company is cooperating in that inquiry which, to the best of the Company's knowledge, is continuing.\nSee also Item 1. Business-Internal Investigation.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings, including claims from ePayment Solutions, two additional merchants, and the Bank of Nevis.

(\u201cMTF\u201d). The Complaint alleges claims for breach of contract against the Company and tortious interference with contract against the Individual Defendants and MTF arising from the termination of the Professional Service Agreements, dated as of January 8, 2016, between the Company and each of the Plaintiffs. The Individual Defendants have been sued for actions taken by them in connection with their service to the Company as directors and/or officers of the Company. As such, the Company has certain indemnification obligations to the Individual Defendants. The Company and the Individual Defendants intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in the Complaint. Based on the very early stage of the litigation, it is not possible to estimate the amount or range of any possible loss arising from the expenditure of defense fees, a judgment or settlement of the matter.\nIn July 2018, AFH Holding & Advisory, LLC, Amir Heshmatpour, Steve Richards, and Bessie (Chia) Soo (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed a verified shareholder derivative complaint (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) in Massachusetts federal court against Bruce Stroever, John Booth, Stephen LaNeve, Bret Hankey, James Delshad (the \u201cInitial Defendants\u201d), and The Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, Inc.

The Complaint alleged claims for violation of Section 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duties, rescission of a reverse stock split, and in the alternative rescissory damages. The Complaint focused on the financing transaction that the Company completed with Hankey Capital in July 2018. The Initial Defendants and the Company filed motions to dismiss on September 28, 2018. After changing counsel and obtaining several extensions of time, instead of responding to the motions to dismiss, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint (the \u201cAmended Complaint\u201d) on February 8, 2019 as a direct, instead of derivative complaint, and added two additional defendants, Don Hankey and Hankey Capital LLC (the \u201cAdded Defendants\u201d and together with the Initial Defendants, MTF and the Company, the \u201cCurrent Defendants\u201d). The Amended Complaint asserted claims for violation of Section 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duties, rescission of a reverse stock split, and in the alternative rescissory damages. On February 22, 2019, the Company and the Initial Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. The Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint was granted in its entirety on July 29, 2019, with the court dismissing the claims for violation of Section 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with prejudice, and dismissing the remaining claims for lack of jurisdiction.\nIn the normal course of our business, we may periodically become subjected to various lawsuits.

We have conducted and paid for (at an immaterial cost to us) remediation of contamination on the property.\nWe have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses.

The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, approximated its carrying value.\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flow.\nAs we seek to provide capital to a broad range of life science companies, institutions and investors with the majority of our finance receivables portfolio paying interest based on floating interest rates with a LIBOR floor, our net investment income is dependent, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and the rate at which we lend those funds to third parties. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by providing capital at variable interest rates. We do not currently engage in any interest rate hedging activities. We constantly monitor our portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any of our investments.\nDuring 2018, we entered into a revolving credit facility. As we borrow funds to make additional investments, our income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we have debt outstanding, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our income, especially to the extent we continue to hold fixed rate investments. We generally seek to mitigate this risk by pricing our debt investments with floating interest rates to maintain the spread of our portfolio over the cost of leverage. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, which we have not done. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our investment income, net of borrowing expenses.\nInflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or operations.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe company is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. To manage its exposure to interest rate changes, the Company uses a combination of variable rate short-term and fixed rate long-term financial instruments. The Company may, from time to time, employ a small number of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nThe Company is, however, required by terms negotiated with its lenders to engage in interest rate swaps once certain thresholds are exceeded with regard to floating rate debt as a percentage of the Company's total debt. The Company exceeded this threshold during 2000 and, accordingly, entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling $130 million. The purpose of these agreements is to hedge against changes in market interest rates to be charged on the Company's borrowings against the credit facility.\nThese swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties. Because these amounts are not exchanged, the notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the Company's exposure resulting from these derivatives. The amounts to be exchanged between the parties are primarily the result of the swap's notional amount and the fixed and floating rate percentages to be charged on the swap. Interest rate differentials associated with the Company's interest rate swaps are recorded as an adjustment to interest payable or receivable with the offset to interest expense over the life of the swap.\nPotential non-performance by counter-parties to the swap agreements exposes the Company to a certain amount of credit risk due to the possibility of counter-party default. Because the Company's only counter-parties in these transactions are financial institutions who are at least investment grade, it believes the risk of counter-party default is minimal.\nInterest Rate Risk Management - The Company's objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs.\nThe following table sets forth the face amounts, maturity dates and average interest rates for the fixed- and floating-rate debt held by the Company at December 31, 2000 (excluding the PSINet forward sale and capital leases):\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and uses a combination of variable rate short-term and fixed rate long-term financial instruments to manage its exposure.

Market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices. The Operating Partnership manages its market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from its operating, investment and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments, distributions to shareholders, investments, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.

Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and bank term loans bear interest at variable rates. Our long-term debt, which consists of secured and unsecured long-term financings, typically bears interest at fixed rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit generally the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars, swaps, caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to existing and prospective debt instruments. We generally do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $2,284.0 million principal amount of fixed rate debt outstanding, a $248.3 million increase as compared to December 31, 2019, excluding debt with a variable rate that is effectively fixed by related interest rate hedge contracts. The estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt was $2,452.8 million.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Exposure - Non-Recourse Notes Payable\nAs of February 28, 2019 and 2018, all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixed-rate installment contracts. Financing for these receivables was achieved primarily through non-recourse funding vehicles that, in turn, issued both fixed- and variable-rate notes. Non-recourse funding vehicles include warehouse facilities and asset-backed term funding transactions.\nBorrowings under our warehouse facilities are variable-rate debt and are secured by auto loan receivables. The receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through an asset-backed term funding transaction, which issue notes payable that accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates.\nInterest rate risk related to variable-rate debt is primarily mitigated by entering into derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables. Disruptions in the credit markets or unexpected changes in prepayment activity could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies. Generally, changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings; however, they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows.\nAbsent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk, a 100-basis point increase in market interest rates associated with non-recourse funding vehicles would have decreased our fiscal 2019 net earnings per share by approximately $0.09.\nCredit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement. We mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties. The market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments. See Notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nCOMPOSITION OF NON-RECOURSE NOTES PAYABLE\n(1)\nVariable-rate debt includes borrowings under our warehouse facilities as well as the variable portion of borrowings under our asset-backed term funding transactions. See Note 11.\nInterest Rate Exposure - Other Debt\nWe have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our term loan; however, a portion of the variable-rate risk is mitigated by a derivative instrument. Substantially all of these borrowings are variable-rate debt based on LIBOR. A 100-basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2019 net earnings per share by approximately $0.01.\nOther Market Exposures\nOur pension plan has interest rate risk related to its projected benefit obligation (\u201cPBO\u201d). Due to the relatively young overall age of the plan\u2019s participants, a 100-basis point change in the discount rate has approximately a 20% effect on the PBO balance. A 100-basis point decrease in the discount rate would have decreased our fiscal 2019 net earnings per share by less than $0.01. See Note 10 for more information on our benefit plans.\nAs our cash-settled restricted stock units are liability awards, the related compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the company\u2019s stock price. The mark-to-market effect on the liability depends on each award\u2019s grant price and previously recognized expense. At February 28, 2019, a $1.00 change in the company\u2019s stock price would have affected fiscal 2019 net earnings per share by less than $0.01.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: The company has exposure to market risk from its non-recourse notes payable, other debt, pension plan, and cash-settled restricted stock units.

As of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments totaling $31.1 million. We invest our excess cash in investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity. To achieve this objective, we invest in money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, high quality marketable debt instruments of corporations and financial institutions, and government sponsored and asset-backed securities with contractual maturity dates of less than one years. If interest rates were to increase instantaneously and uniformly by 100 basis points, compared to interest rates as of December 31, 2019, the increase would not have had a material effect on our results of operations.\nWe do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash and cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits.\nOur Term Loans bear interest at variable rates equal to the sum of the prime rate, as reported in the Wall Street Journal on the last date of the month preceding the month in which interest will accrue, plus 4.10%. Accordingly, increases in these published rates would increase our interest payments under the Term Loans. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase expense by approximately $0.1 million annually and would not materially affect our results of operations.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe incur expenses, including for clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites, outside the United States based on contractual obligations denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including Pounds Sterling, Euro, Hong Kong dollar and Australian dollar. At the end of each reporting period, these liabilities are converted to U.S. dollars at the then-applicable foreign exchange rate. As a result, our business is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. We do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our expenses, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Pounds Sterling has experienced higher volatility as a result of the British political decision to leave the European Union (Brexit). However, to date, fluctuations including those related to Brexit have not had a significant impact to us and a movement of 10% in the U.S. dollar to Pounds Sterling or U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, manufacturing, clinical trial, and other research and development and administration costs.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk.\nMarket risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument might change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative, hedging or trading purposes, although in the future we might enter into exchange rate hedging arrangements to manage the risks described below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit agreement in effect at December 31, 2019, which was entered into in February 2015 and subsequently amended, bear interest at rates that are variable. Increases in the Prime Rate would increase the interest rate on borrowings under that revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit agreement expired on February 20, 2020.\nOn March 3, 2020, we entered into a new revolving line of credit agreement. Borrowings under the new agreement bear interest at rates that are variable. Increases in the Prime Rate or federal funds rate will increase the interest rate on borrowings under the new agreement. The terms of the new agreement are described in Item 9B. \u201cOther Information\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes. In December 2018, we issued $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2023, or the Notes. Upon certain events and/or if certain conditions are met, the Notes can be redeemed into cash, or converted into cash, shares or combination of cash and shares. Upon conversion or redemption, we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value. The fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our then-current incremental borrowing rate. If our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the Notes, we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations during the period in which the Notes are converted. The implicit interest rate for the notes is 7.30%. An incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of $240.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes would result in a loss of approximately $2.4 million.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under the revolving line of credit agreement, which are subject to a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2019 , there were no amounts due under the agreement. Any debt we incur in the future may also bear interest at variable rates.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.

The Company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk.\nThe Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the Company's unsecured lines of credit and construction loans. The Company primarily enters into fixed and variable rate debt obligations to support acquisitions, development, capital expenditures and working capital needs. The Company continuously evaluates its level of variable debt with respect to total debt and other factors including its assessment of the current and future economic environment. The Company did not have any derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2000, but did have such instruments in previous years. In 1997, the Company entered into two treasury rate lock agreements, the purpose of which was to obtain what the Company considered advantageous pricing for future anticipated debt issuance. In 1998, the Company closed out a treasury rate lock agreement in conjunction with a $53 million secured mortgage loan due in 2005 issued in June 1998. The Company closed out its remaining treasury rate lock agreement in 1998 at a loss of $4.9 million.

The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt and therefore its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate, long-term debt will be available to the Company at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in short-term LIBOR interest rates.

At December 31, 2000, the Company and its subsidiary, CES, had a combined total of $361 million in variable rate debt outstanding. A hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would have had an annualized unfavorable impact of approximately $3.61 million on the Company's earnings and cash flows.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur business activities contain elements of market risk. We consider our principal market risk to be the fluctuation in interest rates. Managing this risk is essential to our business. Accordingly, we have systems and procedures designed to identify and analyze our risks, to establish appropriate policies and thresholds and to continually monitor this risk and thresholds by means of administrative and information technology systems and other policies and processes.\nInterest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, including relative changes in different interest rates, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing debt and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire leveraged loans, high yield bonds and other debt investments and the value of our investment portfolio.\nOur investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including LIBOR and the prime rate. A large portion of our portfolio is, and we expect will continue to be, comprised of floating rate investments that utilize LIBOR. Our interest expense is affected by fluctuations in LIBOR only on our revolving credit facility. At February 28, 2019, we had $284.5 million of borrowings outstanding. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of February 28, 2019.\nWe have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income from investments. Assuming that our investments as of February 28, 2019 were to remain constant for a full fiscal year and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate terms, a hypothetical change of a 1.0% increase in interest rates would cause a corresponding increase of approximately $2.8 million to our interest income. Conversely, a hypothetical change of a 1.0% decrease in interest rates would cause a corresponding decrease of approximately $2.7 million to our interest income.\nAlthough management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the statements of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could magnify or diminish our sensitivity to interest rate changes, nor does it account for divergences in LIBOR and the commercial paper rate, which have historically moved in tandem but, in times of unusual credit dislocations, have experienced periods of divergence. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not materially differ from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate.\nFor further information, the following table shows the approximate annualized increase or decrease in the components of net investment income due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investments and borrowings as of February 28, 2019.\nThe table above assumes no defaults or prepayments by portfolio companies over the next twelve months. The hypothetical results would also be impacted by the changes in the amount of debt outstanding under our Credit Facility (with an increase (decrease) in the debt outstanding under the Credit Facility resulting in an (increase) decrease in the hypothetical interest expense).\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk associated with the company's business activities.

{"section": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRisk Management\nThe Company's principal business activities by their nature involve significant market, credit and other risks. The Company's effectiveness in managing these risks is critical to its success and stability.\nAs part of its normal business operations, the Company engages in the trading of both fixed income and equity securities in both a proprietary and market-making capacity. The Company makes markets in over-the-counter equities in order to facilitate order flow and accommodate its institutional and retail customers. The Company also makes markets in municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, government bonds and high yield bonds and short term fixed income securities and loans issued by various corporations.\nMarket Risk. Market risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices. Market risk is inherent in all types of financial instruments, including both derivatives and non-derivatives. The Company's exposure to market risk arises from its role as a financial intermediary for its customers' transactions and from its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities.\nOppenheimer monitors market risks through daily profit and loss statements and position reports. Each trading department adheres to internal position limits determined by senior management and regularly reviews the age and composition of its proprietary accounts. Positions and profits and losses for each trading department are reported to senior management on a daily basis.\nIn its market-making activities, Oppenheimer must provide liquidity in the equities for which it makes markets. As a result of this, Oppenheimer has risk containment policies in place, which limit position size and monitor transactions on a minute-to-minute basis.\nCredit Risk. Credit risk represents the loss that the Company would incur if a client, counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by the Company fails to perform its contractual obligations. The Company follows industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral wherever possible. The Company adjusts margin requirements if it believes the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. When Oppenheimer advances funds or securities to a counterparty in a principal transaction or to a customer in a brokered transaction, it is subject to the risk that the counterparty or customer will not repay such advances. If the market price of the securities purchased or loaned has declined or increased, respectively, Oppenheimer may be unable to recover some or all of the value of the amount advanced. A similar risk is also present where a customer is unable to respond to a margin call and the market price of the collateral has dropped. In addition, Oppenheimer's securities positions are subject to fluctuations in market value and liquidity.\nIn addition to monitoring the credit-worthiness of its customers, Oppenheimer imposes more conservative margin requirements than those of the FINRA Rule 4210. Generally, Oppenheimer limits customer loans to an amount not greater than 65% of the value of the securities (or lower if the securities in the account are concentrated in a limited number of issues). Particular attention and more restrictive requirements are placed on more highly volatile securities traded in the NASDAQ market. In comparison, the FINRA Rule 4210 permits loans of up to 75% of the value of the equity securities in a customer's account.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Swaps\nDue to our variable-rate indebtedness, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We use fixed interest rate swaps to manage this exposure. These derivative instruments are reported at fair value in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in other comprehensive income. For derivatives not designated as hedges, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings. No components of our hedging instruments were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional value. The gain or loss on the interest rate swap is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nWe do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. By their nature, all such instruments involve risk, including the possibility that a loss may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of a contract (credit risk) or the possibility that future changes in market price may make a financial instrument less valuable or more onerous (market risk). As is customary for these types of instruments, we do not require collateral or other security from other parties to these instruments. We believe that there is no significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance of the counterparties to these financial instruments.\nWe formally designate and document instruments at inception that qualify for hedge accounting of underlying exposures in accordance with GAAP. We assess, both at inception and for each reporting period, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the related underlying exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of $21.2 million.\nA hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by 1.0% on variable rate debt would have had an approximate $16.4 million impact on our interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates. Market risk related to interest rates is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We do not believe that inflation has a material impact on our financial position or results of operations during periods covered by the financial statements included in this Report.\nCredit Risk\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. In 2019, no customers exceeded 10% of revenues. In 2018, one customer exceeded 10% of revenues. This customer accounted for 13% of our revenues in 2018. At December 31, 2019, we had no customers whose accounts receivable balance exceeded 10% of total receivables. At December 31, 2018, we had two customers whose accounts receivable balances each exceeded 10% of total receivables. Approximately 10% of our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2018 was from each of these two customers. We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees, although collateral is generally not required.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates due to its variable-rate indebtedness and uses fixed interest rate swaps to manage this exposure.

There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith and valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of management judgment. In addition, our valuation methodology utilizes discount rates in part in valuing our investments, and changes in those discount rates may have an impact on the valuation of our investments. Accordingly, valuations by us do not necessarily represent the amounts which may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments. Estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investment existed, and the differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments, cash and cash equivalents and idle funds investments. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs.

We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on this review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to the LIBOR and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan.

Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances and current activity. For derivative instruments entered into as part of our hedging program, we are subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty is unable to meet its settlement commitments. We actively manage this credit risk by selecting counterparties that we believe to be financially strong and continue to monitor their financial health. Concentration of credit risk is regularly reviewed to ensure that counterparty credit risk is adequately diversified.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the substantial majority of the credit exposure related to our derivative financial instruments was with investment grade counterparties.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nMarket risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The primary risk that we believe we are and will be exposed to is interest rate risk. Certain of our leases contain escalations based on market indices, and the interest rate on our Credit Facility is variable. Although we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions of our loans and leases to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate, as applicable, these features do not eliminate this risk. To that end, we have entered into derivative contracts to cap interest rates for our variable rate notes payable, and we have entered into interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed interest rate to our respective counterparty, and receive one month LIBOR in return. For details regarding our rate cap agreements and our interest rate swap agreements see Note 6 - Mortgage Notes Payable and Credit Facility of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nTo illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income for the year ended December 31, 2019, we have performed the following analysis, which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and that no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity.\nThe following table summarizes the annual impact of a 1%, 2% and 3% increase, and a 1% decrease in the one month LIBOR as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, our effective average LIBOR was 1.76%.

Interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our debt instruments. If interest rates on our debt instruments, using rates at December 31, 2019, had been one percentage point higher or lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased by $17.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively.\nThe amount outstanding under the Credit Facility approximates fair value as of December 31, 2019.\nIn the future, we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes, primarily as a result of our Revolver, Term Loan or long-term mortgage debt, which we use to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations.

Our borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a floating rate and the borrowings under our SBA debentures, 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes bear interest at a fixed rate. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio.\nBased on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2019, the following table shows the approximate annualized increase (decrease) in components of net assets resulting from operations of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investments and borrowings.\nWe do not currently engage in any hedging activities. However, we may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations (and foreign currency) by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against changes in interest rates (and foreign currency), they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our borrowed funds and higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not engage in interest rate (or foreign currency) hedging activities.\nAlthough we believe that the foregoing analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in our portfolio. It also does not adjust for other business developments, including borrowings under our SBA debentures, 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities that could affect the net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. It also does not assume any repayments from borrowers. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above.\nBecause we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the future, money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by variable rate assets in our investment portfolio.\nFor additional information regarding the interest rate associated with each of our SBA debentures, 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities, refer to \u201cItem 7.

Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we, our investment adviser or administrator may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies.\nWe are named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed on March 5, 2016, and captioned Intrepid Investments, LLC v. London Bay Capital, which is pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The plaintiff immediately agreed to stay the action in light of an ongoing mediation among parties other than us. This lawsuit was brought by a member of Speedwell Holdings (formerly known as The Selling Source, LLC), one of our portfolio investments, against various members of and lenders to Speedwell Holdings. The plaintiff asserts claims of aiding and abetting, breaches of fiduciary duty, and tortious interference against us. In June 2018, Intrepid Investments, LLC (\u201cIntrepid\u201d) sent notice to the court and defendants effectively lifting the stay and triggering defendants\u2019 obligation to respond to the Intrepid complaint. In September 2018, we joined the other defendants in a motion to dismiss on various grounds. In February 2019, Intrepid filed a second amended complaint to which defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss in March 2019. We intend to continue to monitor the matter and will assess the need to defend the matter further as necessary.\nIn July 2016, Full Circle filed suit in the District Court of Caldwell County, Texas against, among others, Willis Pumphrey for breach of a guaranty agreement arising from a loan transaction with Full Circle. Dr. Pumphrey, a personal guarantor of the loan made by Full Circle, our predecessor in interest, brought counterclaims in (i) the District Court of Caldwell County, Texas and (ii) the District Court of Harris County, Texas (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) against, among others, Justin Bonner, an employee of GECM, in each case, alleging breach of a confidentiality agreement and tortious interference with Dr. Pumphrey\u2019s attempted sale of a business in which he owned an interest. In August 2017, Dr. Pumphrey voluntarily withdrew his complaint against Mr. Bonner and Full Circle in the District Court of Harris County, Texas. In November 2017, Dr. Pumphrey voluntarily withdrew his complaint without prejudice against Full Circle in the District Court of Caldwell County, Texas. On November 29, 2017, Dr. Pumphrey refiled his claims in the District Court of Harris County, Texas naming Full Circle, MAST Capital, GECC and GECM as defendants. Dr. Pumphrey is seeking between $2 million and $6 million in damages. GECC believes Dr. Pumphrey\u2019s claims to be frivolous and intends to vigorously defend them. Furthermore, we continue to pursue our initial claims against Dr. Pumphrey in the District Court of Caldwell County, Texas. In September 2019, we received a judgment in our favor from the District Court of Caldwell County, Texas.\nIn September 2018, we (as successor by merger to Full Circle), the other lenders, and the lender trustee under PEAKS Trust 2009-11 (\u201cPEAKS Trust\u201d), were named as defendants in a claim brought by the Chapter 7 trustee in the ITT Educational Services bankruptcy. Full Circle purchased via assignment a portion of the PEAKS Trust senior secured facility from Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas in December 2016. The PEAKS Trust senior secured facility was supported by an underlying portfolio of student loans and guaranteed by ITT Educational Services, Inc. (\u201cITT\u201d). In September 2016, ITT and its affiliates filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Following the Chapter 7 filing, a trustee was appointed who initiated a proceeding against certain Deutsche Bank entities and the investors in the PEAKS Trust, including GECC. On November 2, 2018, the trustee filed a motion seeking to stay the litigation in order to facilitate settlement. We are continuing to monitor these proceedings.\nItem 4.", "summary": "Legal Proceedings Summary:\nGECC is currently involved in several legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the financial markets, including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our variable-rate indebtedness associated with our Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate principal amounts of such variable-rate indebtedness were $3,629.6 million and $3,363.8 million, respectively. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities may from time to time bear interest at variable rates, as further described in Note 14. Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report, in certain cases subject to a floor. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, a hypothetical 1% increase in the applicable rate over the floor would have resulted in $36.3 million and $33.6 million, respectively, of incremental interest expense (representing the annual rate of expense) related to our variable-rate debt borrowings.\nTo the extent that we utilize additional amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise increase the amount of our variable-rate indebtedness, we will be exposed to additional interest rate risk.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no other assets or liabilities with significant interest rate sensitivity.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe operate and transact business in various foreign countries and are therefore subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company manages this foreign currency risk, in part, through operational means including managing foreign currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and foreign currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. The Company is also exposed to potential earnings effects from intercompany foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from normal trade receivables and payables and other intercompany loans. Additionally, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries maintain their books of record in currencies other than their respective functional currencies. These subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements are remeasured into their respective functional currencies. Such remeasurement adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nAll assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries, which maintain their financial statements in local currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and short-term intercompany receivables from foreign subsidiaries are included in Other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 19. Other Expense (Income), Net in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for the amount of Foreign currency loss (gain), net.\nBased on the Company\u2019s significant foreign currency denominated intercompany loans, we separately considered the hypothetical impact of a 10% change in the underlying currencies of our foreign currency denominated intercompany loans, relative to the U.S. dollar, at December 31, 2019 and 2018. A 10% change at December 31, 2019 would have resulted in approximately $11 million in incremental foreign currency losses on such date. A 10% change at December 31, 2018 would have resulted in approximately $9 million in incremental foreign currency losses on such date.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A. of the report discusses the market risk of the company, which includes interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.

{"section": "Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, but we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long-term fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible.\nThe following disclosures of estimated fair value of financial instruments are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of important assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows, risks, discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. Readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in these paragraphs are forward-looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading \u201cForward-looking Statements and Factors Affecting Future Results\u201d set forth above. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange.\nMortgage notes receivable - The fair value of mortgage notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.\nDirect financing leases - The fair value of the investments in direct financing leases are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates being offered for similar leases to borrowers with similar credit ratings. In addition, we may estimate the fair value of its investment based on the estimated fair value of the collateral using a market approach which reflects of the expected proceeds from the buyer based on the terms of the sale agreement.\nOther investments - The fair value of other investments is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.\nBorrowings under our credit agreements and term loan - The fair value of our borrowings under our credit agreements and term loan is estimated using an expected present value technique based on expected cash flows discounted using the current credit-adjusted risk-free rate.\nSenior unsecured notes and HUD mortgages -The fair value of the senior unsecured notes and HUD mortgages is estimated based on open market trading activity provided by third parties.\nThe market value of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages is subject to interest rate risks. Generally, the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall. The estimated fair value of our total long-term borrowings at December 31, 2019 was approximately $5.5 billion. A one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long-term borrowings by approximately $296.2 million at December 31, 2019.\nWe may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk. We use interest rate swap agreements, for example, to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixed-rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. At December 31, 2019, $3.7 million of qualifying cash flow hedges were recorded at fair value in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2018, $4.0 million of qualifying cash flow hedges were recorded at fair value in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nItem 8", "summary": "A provides a summary of the market risks associated with the company's long-term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages.

As we continue to expand our operations in China, we have been increasingly exposed to currency risk related to our CNY-denominated revenue. In general, a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against CNY has a negative effect on our operating income. Our Euro-denominated expenses associated with our European operations (manufacturing sites, a distribution facility and sales representatives) provide a natural hedge for Euro-denominated revenues.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\nInterest Rate Hedging Activities\nThe Company\u2019s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had entered into five interest rate swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows on $175.0 million of the unsecured term debt. As of December 31, 2019, the Company also had $255.4 million of secured variable rate indebtedness. All of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the notional amount, carrying value, and estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s cash flow hedge derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of December 31, 2019. The notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rates or market risks. The table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on the Company\u2019s derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10-year Treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points, as of December 31, 2019.\nAdditionally, the Company has entered into total return swap contracts, with an aggregate notional amount of $255.4 million that effectively convert $255.4 million of fixed mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on the SIFMA plus a spread and have a carrying value of zero at December 31, 2019. The Company is exposed to insignificant interest rate risk on these swaps as the related mortgages are callable, at par, by the Company, co-terminus with the termination of any related swap. These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.\nInterest Rate Sensitive Liabilities\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long-term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company\u2019s real estate investment portfolio and operations. The Company\u2019s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, the Company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nThe Company\u2019s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows. Management has estimated the fair value of the Company\u2019s $5.2 billion of fixed rate debt at December 31, 2019, to be $5.4 billion. Management has estimated the fair value of the Company\u2019s $660.4 million of variable rate debt at December 31, 2019, to be $655.8 million based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace. The following table represents scheduled principal payments ($ in thousands):\n(1)\n$175.0 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements ($175.0 million is subject to interest rate swaps). $255.4 million is subject to total return swaps.\nThe table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2019; it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.

We believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From these analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, prepayment or standby letter of credit.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe operate in international markets, which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and various foreign currencies. Historically, the majority of our revenue contracts and arrangements with third party suppliers are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Additionally, a portion of our expenses, primarily the cost to manufacture, cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services, sales and sales support and research and development, are denominated in foreign currencies. Revenue resulting from selling in currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income. As foreign currency exchange rates vary, operating income may differ from expectations. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive relative to competing products priced in such other currencies, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could result in our foreign suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. However, we do not expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to have a material effect on our results of operations.\nFDS uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rates movement on FDS\u2019 assets and liabilities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities. Our Credit Facility is comprised of a Term B loan and a revolving credit agreement with interest rates as described under Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt the end of fiscal 2019, we had outstanding the Term B loan of $300.0 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2019 could result in approximately $1.9 million annual increase in interest expense on these existing principal balances.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A is a disclosure of FDS's exposure to financial market risks, including credit risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and interest rate risk. FDS assesses credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and uses derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. FDS is also exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under its credit facilities, which could result in an increase in interest expense."}

The plaintiffs purport to represent an alleged class of passengers who purchased Booksafe Travel Protection Plans. The complaint alleged that the Company concealed that it received proceeds on the sale of the travel insurance portion of the plan. The complaint sought an unspecified amount of damages, fees and costs. The Company moved to invoke the arbitration clause of the ticket contract to move the case out of Federal Court. On May 29, 2019, the Court granted the motion and compelled the plaintiffs to submit their claims to arbitration on an individual basis, dismissing the claims before the Court with prejudice. The plaintiffs filed an appeal on October 28, 2019. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claim and that any liability which may arise as a result of this action will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nHelms-Burton Act\nOn August 27, 2019, two lawsuits were filed against Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The complaint filed by Havana Docks Corporation alleges it holds an interest in the Havana Cruise Port Terminal and the complaint filed by Javier Garcia-Bengochea alleges that he holds an interest in the Port of Santiago, Cuba, both of which were expropriated by the Cuban Government. The complaints further allege that the Company \u201ctrafficked\u201d in those properties by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities. The plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies, including the value of the expropriated property, plus interest, treble damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On January 7, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed the claim by Havana Docks Corporation. We believe that the plaintiff plans to appeal the order.

{"section": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nOn November 5, 2012, CA, Inc. filed an action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that we willfully infringe certain of its U.S. patents. CA, Inc. asserts that a portion of our application performance management software-the .NET and Java agents-infringes certain claims of those patents. Among other things, CA, Inc. has sought permanent injunctive relief against us and damages in an amount to be determined at trial. Specifically, CA, Inc. alleges in the complaint that we willfully infringe certain CA, Inc. United States Patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 7,225,361 B2, or the \u2019361 patent, 7,512,935 B1, or the \u2019935 patent, and 7,797,580 B2, or the \u2019580 patent. Discovery is complete in the case, and the court has ruled on summary judgment motions filed by both parties. On April 8, 2015, the court granted CA, Inc.\u2019s partial summary judgment motion seeking to estop New Relic from contesting the validity of the \u2019361 and \u2019580 patents. On September 28, 2015, the court granted New Relic\u2019s partial summary judgment motion as to non-infringement of the \u2019935 patent by the Java and .NET agents, and denied summary judgment as to invalidity of the \u2019935 patent. Following the court\u2019s summary judgment rulings, the only remaining claims for infringement in this litigation are CA, Inc.\u2019s assertions that the Java agent infringes asserted claims of the \u2019361 and \u2019580 patents. A trial date has been set for November 4, 2019.\nWe intend to continue to contest this lawsuit vigorously. If this matter has an adverse outcome, it may have an impact on our financial position, results from operations, and cash flows. Should CA, Inc. prevail on its claims, we could be required to pay substantial damages for past sales of such products, enjoined from using and selling such products if a license or other right to continue selling our products is not made available to us, and required to pay substantial ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. Any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business. However, we cannot at this time predict the likely outcome of this proceeding or estimate the amount or range of loss or possible loss that may arise from it. Even if we were to prevail, litigation is costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from purchasing our products, either of which could materially harm our business.\nDuring the course of litigation, we anticipate announcements of the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments related to the litigation, which our competitors could try to use to their competitive advantage by creating uncertainty amongst our customers. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and are subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nItem 4.", "summary": "Mine Safety Disclosures\n\nCA, Inc. has filed a lawsuit against New Relic in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging that New Relic's .NET and Java agents infringe certain of its U.S. patents.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nIn the ordinary course of operations, our financial position and cash flows are subject to a variety of risks, which include market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and movement in interest rates. We do not, in the normal course of business, use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable, such as political, economic, tax, other regulatory or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of our market risks.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES\nOperations outside of the U.S. expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes and could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies. During 2000, 27.4% of our total revenue was generated from our international operations, and the net assets of our foreign subsidiaries totaled 12% of consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2000. Our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business. We operate outside the U.S. primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in England, France, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. These foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency, as sales are generated and expenses are incurred in such currencies. Foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our operations as compared to the U.S. dollar, and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure. We do not believe that possible near-term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on our future earnings or cash flows and, therefore, have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments. There can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a sudden and significant decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar.\nINTEREST RATES\nOur exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments in marketable securities as our related-party note receivable was repaid in full during 2000. Our investments, including cash equivalents, consist of U.S., federal, state and municipal bonds, as well as domestic corporate bonds, with maturities of greater than 12 months. All investments are classified as available-for-sale as defined in SFAS No. 115, \"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,\" and accordingly are carried at market value. Our short-term investment objectives are safety, liquidity and yield. Additionally, interest income on our related party receivable was based on a floating interest rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 2.05%. Changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income or could impact the fair market value of our investments. However, we believe these changes in interest rates will not cause a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that the company is exposed to in its operations.

It is possible that Edwards Lifesciences may be added as a defendant in these cases and claims.\nEdwards Lifesciences is also subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The counterparties are major financial institutions.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company had $785 million of external variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2020. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Company\u2019s external variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2020 would be $7.85 million on a pre-tax basis.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions.\nThe estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices.\nThe estimated potential loss under foreign exchange contracts from movement in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) sensitivity analysis model to estimate the maximum potential economic loss from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates over a one-day period given a 95% confidence level. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. The estimated maximum one-day loss in the fair value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency exchange contracts using the VAR model was $0.7 million at December 31, 2020. The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses under foreign exchange contracts would not exceed the estimated losses. The amounts disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and should not be construed as an endorsement of the VAR model or the accuracy of the related assumptions.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are subject to commodity price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. From time to time, we use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price volatility.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary: The Company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Risk\nTo date, our international customer and vendor agreements have been denominated mostly in United States dollars. Accordingly, we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions. The functional currency of certain foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Accordingly, the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of these foreign subsidiaries\u2019 operations are accounted for as translation gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders\u2019 equity. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in such foreign currency exchange rates would result in a change to translation gain/loss in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $0.3 million.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOn May 12, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders and a collateral agent in connection with the acquisition of Exar. The credit agreement provides for an initial secured term B loan facility (the \u201cInitial Term Loan\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, aggregate borrowings under the Initial Term Loan were $212.0 million. The credit agreement permits the Company to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of $160.0 million (subject to adjustments for any voluntary prepayments), plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with certain secured leverage ratio and total leverage ratio tests. Incremental loans are subject to certain additional conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from the lenders then party to the credit agreement or new lenders. The term loan facility has a seven-year term and bears interest at either an Adjusted LIBOR or an Adjusted Base Rate, at our option, and, in each case, plus a fixed applicable margin. In November 2017, to hedge a substantial portion of our existing interest rate risk with respect to the term loans, we entered into a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreement with an amortizing notional amount to swap some of our variable rate interest payments under our term loans for fixed interest payments bearing an interest rate of 1.74685% through October 2020. Our outstanding debt is still subject to a 2.5% fixed applicable margin during the term of the loan. As a result of entering the swap, the interest rate on a substantial portion of our long-term debt is effectively fixed at approximately 4.25% through October 2020. However, interest rate trends are inherently difficult to predict and interest rates may significantly increase or decrease over a short period of time. Should interest rates trend below that of our fixed swap interest rate, we may pay higher interest expense than market and seek to terminate or modify the terms of the swap prior to its maturity which could result in termination or other fees. We are also still subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance in excess of the notional amount of the interest rate swap and could be adversely impacted by rising interest rates and/or decreased prepayments of principal in the future. If LIBOR interest rates had increased by 10%, or 1000 basis points, during the periods presented, the rate increase would have resulted in an increase of approximately $0.02 million to interest expense.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk exposure of the company, which is primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

On January 12, 2018, after an initial round of successful motion to dismiss briefing leading to Plaintiff filing an amended complaint, we and the named individual defendants filed another motion to dismiss on the grounds that the amended complaint failed to state a claim because it did not plead falsity or scienter. On June 27, 2018, the Court granted our motion to dismiss without leave to amend and entered judgment in favor of us and the other defendants. On July 24, 2018, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals; however, Plaintiff subsequently filed a voluntary notice dismissing the appeal and, thus, ending the litigation on November 1, 2018.\nOn February 8, 2018, two putative class action complaints were filed against us, our CEO, and our former CFO in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Hessefort v. Super Micro Computer, Inc., et al., No. 18-cv-00838 and United Union of Roofers v. Super Micro Computer, Inc., et al., No. 18-cv-00850). The complaints contain similar allegations, claiming that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act due to alleged misrepresentations and/or omissions in public statements regarding recognition of revenue. The court subsequently appointed New York Hotel Trades Council & Hotel Association of New York City, Inc. Pension Fund as lead plaintiff and it filed an amended complaint naming our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations as an additional defendant. On June 21, 2019, plaintiff filed a further amended complaint naming our former Senior Vice President of International Sales, Corporate Secretary, and Director as an additional defendant.

We monitor our interest rate risk, but do not engage in any hedging activities using derivative financial instruments. For additional information regarding our debt structure, refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements titled, \u201cDebt.\u201d\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nWe are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This foreign currency exchange risk arises when we conduct business in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. For most operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. The financial statements of subsidiaries are translated to their U.S. dollar equivalents at end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and at average currency exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Translation adjustments for subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements titled, \u201c Reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss),\u201d contains additional information about the impact of translation on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and equity. Transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Since we operate internationally and approximately 30% of our revenues and 40% of our cost of revenues are generated outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact our financial position, results of operations, and competitive position.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including inter-company transactions. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At March 31, 2020, we held a foreign currency forward contract to buy 6.0 million Canadian dollars.\nCOMMODITY RISK\nWe are dependent on basic raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies used in our operations. Our financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials. Some of these materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or only a single supplier. These materials are also key source materials for our competitors. Therefore, if demand for these materials rises, we may experience increased costs and/or limited or unavailable supplies. As a result, we may not be able to acquire key production materials on a timely basis, which could impact our ability to produce products and satisfy incoming sales orders on a timely basis. In addition, the costs of these materials can rise suddenly and result in significantly higher costs of production. We believe that we have adequate sources of supply for many of our key materials and energy sources. Where appropriate, we enter into long-term supply contracts as a basis to guarantee a reliable supply. We may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in a certain commodity that impacts raw materials included in our cost of revenues. At March 31, 2020, we held commodity swap contracts to buy 715,200 pounds of nickel.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks faced by a company in the ordinary course of business.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of bank deposits and money market accounts, U.S. government notes and U.S. agency notes, asset-backed securities, and highly rated corporate debt. At the end of fiscal 2019 and 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,197.5 million and $1,299.2 million. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents reasonably approximates fair value, due to the short maturities of these instruments. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair value of our investments.\nWe considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately $10.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2020.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars with a proportional small number of contracts denominated in foreign currencies. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the British pound and Euro. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. Given the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into any derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency exchange should become more significant.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar at the end of fiscal 2020 to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our loss before income taxes in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on loss before provision for income taxes of approximately $7.6 million at the end of fiscal 2020.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

Below is a description of all legal proceedings we were involved in during the year ended March 31, 2019, and through the date of this filing.\n\u25cf On November 1, 2017, we filed a lawsuit in the Fourth Judicial District Court for Utah County, State of Utah, Wealth Generators, LLC, v. Evan Cabral, Daniel Lopez, John Legarreta, Johnathan Lopez, Julian Kuschner, Nick Gomez, Luke Shulla, Nestor Velazquez, Christopher Terry, Isis De La Torre, Alex Morton, Ivan Briongos, Brandon Boyd, and International Markets Live Ltd. d/b/a iMarketslive, Civil No. 170401615, alleging corporate espionage and misappropriation of corporate information. The lawsuit alleges that International Markets Live Ltd., dba iMarketslive, conspired with a number of individuals affiliated with Wealth Generators to steal our confidential information, intellectual property, and trade secrets. On September 27, 2018, the court issued its ruling granting in part and denying in part our motion for preliminary injunction. On January 2, 2019, the parties entered into a settlement agreement in which they agreed to release all claims and have the litigation dismissed with prejudice, with neither party making any payment to the other, but with the defendants agreeing to make a $5,000 donation to charity. On February 22, 2019, the matter was dismissed with prejudice.\n\u25cf In February 2018, we received a subpoena from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d). We complied with the terms of the subpoena, negotiated a resolution of this matter with the CFTC staff, and a final order was issued on September 14, 2018. Under the order, we did not admit or deny any of the allegations, agreed to pay a fine of $150,000, and agreed not to act as an unregistered commodities trading advisor in the future. As of March 31, 2019, we have paid $90,000 to the CFTC and the remaining unpaid balance has been included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\u25cf Jim Westphal filed a wage claim against Kuvera, LLC (at the time named Wealth Generators, LLC), in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division (Case No. 2:18-cv-00080) in the amount of $6,500 plus liquidated damages. Mr. Westphal is claiming unpaid overtime wages. We contend that Mr. Westphal was an independent contractor, hired on a limited basis to perform software services, and is accordingly not entitled to overtime payments under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Moreover, Mr. Westphal never provided the promised software pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement. We filed a counterclaim on July 12, 2018, seeking damages of approximately $20,000 and demanding a jury trial. In December 2018, the parties settled the matter with a joint motion.

{"section": "ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Central Hudson's primary market risks are commodity price risk and interest rate risk. Exposure to commodity price risk related to its purchases and/or sales of natural gas, fuel for electric generation and power supplies is mitigated in several different ways. Depending on market conditions, Central Hudson enters into long-term fixed supply and long-term forward supply contracts for the purchase and/or sale of these commodities. Central Hudson also uses storage gas facilities to purchase blocks of natural gas at preheating season prices for use during the heating season. Central Hudson also enters into derivative transactions to hedge market price fluctuations.\nCentral Hudson has in place an energy risk management program with the primary goal to further manage, through the use of defined risk management practices, price risk associated with commodity purchases in its operations. Central Hudson's written policy and procedures for this program permit the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge price risk but prohibit their use for speculative purposes. Central Hudson has entered into either exchange-traded futures contracts and over-the-counter\ncontracts with third parties to hedge commodity price risk associated with the purchase and/or sale of natural gas and electricity and derivative contracts to hedge a small portion of its total gas supply requirements as well as some purchased electric and electric sales for resale transactions. The fair value of open positions at December 31, 2000, as well as the resultant net transaction gains related to derivative transactions, were not material to Central Hudson's financial position or results of operation. Derivative transactions occurring in 1999 were not material to Central Hudson's financial position or results of operation. All hedge transactions were accounted for under the deferral method (SFAS 80, \"Accounting for Futures Contracts\") with gains and losses from the hedging activity included in either the cost of the commodity or as an adjustment to revenues.\nCentral Hudson's exposure to commodity price risk related to its purchases of natural gas, fuel for electric generation, and other power sales is also mitigated by its electric and gas cost adjustment clauses. These adjustment clauses provide for the return or collection of costs, including risk management costs, to or from customers for costs below or in excess of base costs included in rates charged to customers. Risk management costs are defined by the PSC as \"costs associated with transactions that are intended to reduce price volatility or reduce overall costs to customers. These costs include transaction costs, and gains and losses associated with other risk management entities.\" Variations in Central Hudson electric fuel costs are also subject to a fuel cost incentive mechanism with an annual exposure of up to $3.0 million in either additional revenues or costs.\nCentral Hudson manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through economic refunding of debt through optional refundings. A portion of Central Hudson's long-term debt consists of variable rate debt for which interest is reset on a periodic basis reflecting current market conditions. The difference between costs associated with actual variable interest rates and costs embedded in customer rates is deferred for eventual passback or recovery to or from customers.\nITEM 8", "summary": "A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nCentral Hudson is exposed to market risk related to commodity price risk and interest rate risk.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending, investing and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure. We do not have any market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes.\nManagement uses various asset/liability strategies to manage the re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within established guidelines of acceptable levels of risk-taking.\nThe board of directors monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact on the net economic value of equity and net interest income from potential changes in interest rates, and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure. We manage our balance sheet in part to maintain the potential impact on economic value of equity and net interest income within acceptable ranges despite changes in interest rates.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by the board of directors. Interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in economic value of equity in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates. If potential changes to net economic value of equity and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the limits established by our board of directors, the board of directors may direct management to adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board-approved limits.\nThe following tables summarize the sensitivity in net interest income and fair value of equity as of the dates indicated, using a parallel ramp scenario.\nThe model simulations as of December 31, 2019 imply that our balance sheet is more neutral compared to our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nAlthough the simulation model is useful in identifying potential exposure to interest rate changes, actual results for net interest income and economic value of equity may differ. There are a variety of factors that can impact the outcomes such as timing and magnitude of interest rate changes, asset and liability mix, pre-payment speeds, deposit beta assumptions, and decay rates that differ from our projections. Additionally, the results do not account for actions implemented to manage our interest rate risk exposure.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur consolidated financial statements and related notes included within this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.\nOur assets and liabilities are substantially monetary in nature. Therefore, changes in interest rates can significantly impact on our performance beyond the general effects of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as prices of general goods and services, while other operating expenses can be correlated with the impact of general levels of inflation.\n.\nITEM 8:", "summary": "Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the Company's global operations. As a result, the Company is subject to business risks inherent in non-U.S. activities, including political and economic uncertainty, import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes that the political and economic risks related to the Company's international operations are mitigated due to the geographic diversity in which the Company's international operations are located.\nEffective July 1, 2018, Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy as the projected three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%. As such, beginning July 1, 2018, the functional currency for the Company\u2019s Argentina subsidiary became the U.S. dollar. Revenue from operations in Argentina represented less than 2% of total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes.\nThe Company's primary currency rate exposures are related to foreign denominated debt, intercompany debt, forward exchange contracts, foreign denominated receivables and payables and cash and short-term investments. A hypothetical 10% change in currency rates would have a favorable/unfavorable impact on fair values on such instruments of $6.0 million and on income before tax of $2.3 million.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities and term notes, which consisted of long-term borrowings of $57.1 million at December 31, 2019. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncluded in the Company\u2019s accounting for defined benefit pension plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) are assumptions on future discount rates and the expected return on Plan assets. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates and Plan asset investment returns. Actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or higher or lower withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension expense or income recorded in the future.\nA discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments. In general, our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and decreases as the discount rate increases. The discount rate used to determine the future benefit obligation was 3.50% and 4.25% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the amounts reported. A 50 basis point change in the discount rate of 3.50% used at December 31, 2019 would have a $3.1 million effect on the Plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation.\nThe Company developed the expected return on Plan assets by considering various factors which include targeted asset allocation percentages, historical returns, and expected future returns. The Company assumed an expected rate of return of 7.00% and 8.00% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

{"section": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and as such, is not required to provide information in response to this item. However, in light of recent events, stockholders should be aware of the following risks associated with an investment in the Company:\nIf Bee Street fails to complete its tender offer for our common stock, our stock price, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure that Bee Street will complete its tender offer for our common stock. If the tender offer is not completed, we will be subject to several risks. Because the current trading price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the tender offer will be completed, failure to complete the tender offer could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Also, we have incurred significant, and may incur additional, costs in connection with the tender offer, including the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the\ntender offer is not completed. A failed transaction may also result in a negative impression of the Company in the investment community.\nThe tender offer by Bee Street may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock, which may could result in substantial losses by investors.\nThe tender offer by Bee Street could affect the trading price of our common stock and increase its volatility, as well as reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Securities class action litigation is commonly instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. The commencement of this type of litigation against us in the future could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe spread of a new strain of coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) may adversely affect our business operations.\nIn December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (also known as, and hereinafter referred to as \u201cCOVID-19\u201d) originated in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to infect many people in the city and surrounding area. In some cases, COVID-19 causes severe illness and even death. Since its discovery, COVID-19 has spread throughout China and to several other countries, significantly impacting their economies. Various measures may be taken by countries, including the United States, both on a macro country-wide level and a local level, to combat the virus and its spread. These may include quarantines or bans on public events.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 may adversely affect our supply chain, results of operations and business generally, depending on the extent of its spread of the virus, the rate of infection, the severity of illness and the probability of lethality, the relative effect on various portions of the population (such as the aged), the measures taken to combat the virus and their effectiveness, the effect on international trade of any measures taken to combat the virus, any action taken (such as the lowering of interest rates) by government entities to combat the negative macroeconomic effects of these measures, the timing and availability of any vaccine for the virus, and other factors.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated a risk exists of a pandemic in the United States, which would mean that the current methods in place to control of the spread of the virus have been ineffective. In such a situation, the effect on the economy and on the public may be severe. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and a potential pandemic, and, as a result, there is considerable uncertainty of its potential effect on our business and results of operations.\nItem 1B.", "summary": "Investors in the Company should be aware of the risks associated with an investment in the Company, including the potential failure of Bee Street to complete its tender offer for the Company's common stock, which could adversely affect the stock price, business, results of operations and financial condition.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2000 includes a significant amount of assets whose fair value is subject to market risk. Since a substantial portion of the Company's investments are in fixed income securities, interest rate fluctuations represent the largest market risk factor affecting the Company's consolidated financial position. Interest rates are managed within a tight duration band, generally averaging 2 to 2.5 years, and credit risk is managed by investing in U.S. government obligations and in corporate debt securities with high average quality ratings and maintaining a diversified sector exposure within the debt securities portfolio. The Company's investment policies are subject to revision based upon market conditions and the Company's cash flow and tax strategies, among other factors. The Company's investment in equity securities as of December 31, 2000 was not significant.\nIn order to determine the sensitivity of the Company's investment portfolio to changes in market risk, valuation estimates were made on each security in the portfolio using a duration model. Duration models measure the expected change in security market prices arising from hypothetical movements in market interest rates. Convexity further adjusts the estimated price change by mathematically \"correcting\" the changes in duration as market interest rates shift. The model used industry standard calculations of security duration and convexity as provided by third party vendors such as Bloomberg and Yield Book. For certain structured notes, callable corporate notes, and callable agency bonds, the duration calculation utilized an option-adjusted approach, which helps to ensure that hypothetical interest rate movements are applied in a consistent way to securities that have embedded call and put features. The model assumed that changes in interest rates were the result of parallel shifts in the yield curve. Therefore, the same basis point change was applied to all maturities in the portfolio. The change in valuation was tested using positive and negative adjustments in yield of 100 and 200 basis points. Hypothetical immediate increases of 100 and 200 basis points in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the Company's investments in debt securities as of December 31, 2000 by approximately $20.6 million and $40.9 million, respectively (compared to $20.6 million and $40.5 million as of December 31 1999, respectively). Hypothetical immediate decreases of 100 and 200 basis points in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the Company's investment in debt securities as of December 31, 2000 by approximately $20.7 million and $41.9 million, respectively (compared to $21.2 million and $42.3 million as of December 31, 1999, respectively). Because duration and convexity are estimated rather than known quantities for certain securities, there can be no assurance that the Company's portfolio would perform in-line with the estimated values.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company's investments in fixed income securities are subject to market risk due to interest rate fluctuations.

The Company believes that none of the claims that were outstanding as of December 31, 2019 will have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations. Please see Note 23, Legal and Regulatory Actions, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nAs described in the Explanatory Note to this Form 10-K, and as previously disclosed in RTI\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2020, the Audit Committee of the Board of RTI, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting advisors, conducted an internal investigation of matters relating to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition practices for certain contractual arrangements, primarily with OEM customers, including the accounting treatment, financial reporting and internal controls related to such arrangements (the \u201cInvestigation\u201d). The Investigative procedures also examined transactions to understand the practices related to manual journal entries for accrual and reserve accounts. The Investigation was precipitated by an investigation by the SEC initially related to the periods 2014 through 2016. The SEC investigation is ongoing, and the Company is cooperating with the SEC in its investigation.\nOn April 7, 2020, the Audit Committee of the Board concluded that the Company will restate its previously issued audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the unaudited financial statements for the quarterly periods within these years commencing with the first quarter of 2016.\nBased on the results of the Investigation, the Company has concluded that revenue for certain invoices should have been recognized at a later date than when originally recognized. In response to binding purchase orders from certain OEM customers, goods were shipped and received by the customers before requested delivery dates and agreed-upon delivery windows. In many instances the OEM customers requested or approved the early shipments, but the Company has determined that on other occasions the goods were delivered early without obtaining the customers\u2019 affirmative approval. Some of those unapproved shipments were shipped by employees in order to generate additional revenue and resulted in shipments being pulled from a future quarter into an earlier quarter. In addition, the Company has concluded that in July 2017 an adjustment was improperly made to a product return provision in the Direct Division. The revenue for those shipments is being restated, as well as for other orders that shipped earlier than the purchase order due date in the system for which the Company could not locate evidence that the OEM customers had requested or approved the shipments. In addition, the Company has concluded that in the periods from 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2018, certain adjustments were incorrectly or erroneously made via manual journal entries to accrual/reserve accounts, including a July 2017 adjustment to a product return provision in the Direct Division, among others. Accordingly, the Company has restated its financial statements to correct these adjustments.\nThere is currently ongoing stockholder litigation related to the Company\u2019s Investigation. A class action complaint was filed by Patricia Lowry against the Company, and certain current and former officers of the Company, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on March 23, 2020 demanding a jury trial.

Nuevo's working interest in these properties is 20%, and its share of the settlement payment was approximately $2.4 million.\nOn September 22, 2000, the Company was named as a defendant in the lawsuit Thomas Wachtell et al. versus Nuevo Energy Company in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California. The plaintiffs, who own certain interests in the Point Pedernales properties, have asserted numerous causes of action including breach of contract, fraud and conspiracy in connection with the plaintiff's allegation that: (i) royalties have not been properly paid to them for production from the Point Pedernales field, (ii) payments have not been made to them related to production from the Sacate field, and, (iii) the Company has failed to recognize the plaintiff's interests in the Tranquillon Ridge project.

The Company and ExxonMobil each own a 50% interest in the Sacate Field, offshore Santa Barbara County, California, which can only be accessed from an existing ExxonMobil platform. The Company has alleged that by grossly inflating the fee that ExxonMobil insists the Company must pay to use an existing ExxonMobil platform and production infrastructure, ExxonMobil failed to submit a proposal for the development of the Sacate field consistent with the Unit Operating Agreement. The Company therefore believes that it has been denied a reasonable opportunity to exercise its rights under the Unit\nNUEVO ENERGY COMPANY\nOperating Agreement. ExxonMobil contends that Nuevo had not consented to the operation and therefore cannot receive its share of production from Sacate until ExxonMobil has first recovered certain costs and fees. As a result, Nuevo has neither received revenues, incurred operating expenses, nor booked any proved reserves related to Sacate. The Company has alleged that ExxonMobil's actions breach the Unit Operating Agreement and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Company is seeking damages and a declaratory judgment as to the payment that must be made to access ExxonMobil's platform and facilities. The Company's capitalized costs associated with Sacate are insignificant.\nThe Company has been named as defendant in certain other lawsuits incidental to its business.

Watts filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division, against XL Systems for infringement of six different patents. We subsequently acquired XL Systems in August 1997, and during our acquisition due diligence review, were advised by our technical and legal advisors that Mr. Watts' claims were without merit and the likelihood of an adverse judgment was remote. At the time of acquisition, we recorded a reserve to cover litigation costs and potential damages based upon the advice we received, of which $500,000 remained as of December 31, 2000.\nFollowing filing of the suit, XL Systems successfully obtained summary judgments against Mr. Watts for virtually all of his patent infringement claims, which summary judgments were upheld upon appeal. In response, Mr. Watts amended his pleadings in November 1999, to add claims of trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract and unjust enrichment, which were subsequently dismissed by the trial court upon XL Systems' motion for summary judgment.\nAs a result of these actions, only Mr. Watts' claim for willful infringement by XL Systems' XLC Connection of Claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 5,427,418 (the \"418 Patent\") remained, which relates to a method for sealing a connection. On March 2, 2001, a jury found that XL Systems' XLC Connection infringed Claim 1 of the 418 Patent and awarded the plaintiff approximately $2.0 million in damages, including prejudgment interest.

Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including finance, administration and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, supplies, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our investors and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems.

BUSINESS\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nDynex Capital, Inc. commenced operations in 1988 and is an internally managed mortgage real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d), which primarily invests in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d). We finance our investments principally with borrowings under repurchase agreements. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term that are reflective of a leveraged, high quality fixed income portfolio with a focus on capital preservation. We seek to provide returns to our shareholders primarily through the payment of regular dividends and through capital appreciation of our investments.\nWe are primarily invested in Agency MBS including residential MBS (\u201cRMBS\u201d), commercial MBS (\u201cCMBS\u201d) and CMBS interest-only (\u201cIO\u201d) securities. Agency MBS have an implicit guaranty of principal payment by an agency of the U.S. government or a U.S. government-sponsored entity (\u201cGSE\u201d) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We also have investments in non-Agency MBS, which consist mainly of CMBS IO. Non-Agency MBS are issued by non-governmental enterprises and do not have a guaranty of principal payment.\nINVESTMENT STRATEGY\nOur investment strategy and the allocation of our capital to a particular sector or investment is driven by a \u201ctop-down\u201d framework that focuses on the risk management, scenario analysis, and expected risk-adjusted returns of any investment. Key points of this framework include the following:\n\u2022understanding macroeconomic factors, including monetary and fiscal policies, and possible evolving outcomes, including but not limited to, the current state of the U.S. and global economies;\n\u2022understanding the regulatory environment, competition for assets, and the terms and availability of financing;\n\u2022sector analysis including understanding absolute returns, relative and risk-adjusted returns, and supply/demand metrics within each sector;\n\u2022security and financing analysis including sensitivity analysis on credit, interest rate volatility, liquidity, and market value risk; and\n\u2022managing performance and inherent portfolio risks, including but not limited to interest rate, credit, prepayment, and liquidity risks.\nIn allocating our capital and executing our strategy, we seek to balance the risks of owning specific types of investments with the earnings opportunity on the investment. At various times during the last decade, we have allocated capital to a variety of investments including adjustable-rate and fixed-rate Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, investment grade and unrated non-Agency RMBS and CMBS, Agency and non-Agency CMBS IO, and residual interests in securitized mortgage loans. Our investments in non-Agency MBS are generally higher quality senior or mezzanine classes (typically rated 'A' or better by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) because they are typically more liquid (i.e., they are more easily converted into cash either through sales or pledges as collateral for repurchase agreement\nborrowings) and have less exposure to credit losses than lower-rated non-Agency MBS. We regularly review our existing operations to determine whether our investment strategy or business model should change, including through capital reallocation, changing our targeted investments, and shifting our risk position.\nThe performance of our investment portfolio will depend on many factors including but not limited to interest rates, trends of interest rates, the steepness of interest rate curves, prepayment rates on our investments, demand for our investments, general market liquidity, and economic conditions and their impact on the credit performance of our investments. In addition, our business model may be impacted by other factors such as the state of the overall credit markets, which could impact the availability and costs of financing.

The Company does not and currently does not intend to hedge exchange rate fluctuations between United States dollars and foreign currencies. However, from time to time, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate exposures. An instrument will be treated as a hedge if it is effective in offsetting the impact of volatility in the Company's underlying interest rate exposures. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.\nRevenue from international customers represented approximately 13% of 2000 net revenues. At December 31, 2000, there were no material non-United States dollar denominated financial instruments outstanding which exposed the Company to foreign exchange risk.\nAs noted above, the Company is exposed to market risk associated with adverse movements in interest rates. Specifically, the Company is primarily exposed to changes in the fair value of its $110 million senior subordinated notes, and to changes in earnings and related cash flows on its variable interest rate debt obligations outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility and its retained interests related to trade accounts receivable and equipment loans sold to the Company's special purpose finance subsidiaries. Borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility totaled $199.5 million at December 31, 2000.\nThe fair value of the Company's senior subordinated notes was approximately $82.5 million based upon prevailing prices in recent market transactions as of December 31, 2000. The Company\nestimates that this fair value would increase/decrease by approximately $5.7 million based upon an assumed 10% decrease/increase in interest rates compared with the effective yield on the senior subordinated notes as of December 31, 2000.\nAn assumed 10% increase/decrease in the variable interest rate of 9.2% in effect at December 31, 2000 related to the term loan borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility would decrease/increase annualized earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.9 million.\nEffective March 10, 1999, the Company entered into a $67 million interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution to hedge a portion of its interest rate risk related to its term loan borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. Under the swap, which has a term of three years, the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.962% and receives quarterly interest payments based upon LIBOR. The differential between the fixed and floating interest rates under the swap is accrued and is recorded as an adjustment of interest expense. The effect of this agreement on the Company's interest expense during 2000 was a reduction of $1.0 million. The fair value of this interest rate swap agreement which represents the amount that the Company would receive to settle the instrument is $0.7 million at December 31, 2000.\nAn assumed 10% increase/decrease in interest rates under the Asset Backed Facility at December 31, 2000 would not have a material effect on the fair value of the retained interest in sold trade accounts receivable due to the short-term nature of the underlying receivables. Finally, based upon the mix of variable and fixed rate equipment loans sold by the Company, a 10% increase/decrease in interest rates would decrease/increase the fair value of the Company's retained interests at December 31, 2000 of $21.4 million by less than $1.0 million.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.

The primary financial risks include fluctuations in interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates. We manage these risks by using derivative instruments. We do not invest in derivative securities for trading purposes, but do enter into hedging arrangements in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as well as to fluctuations in exchange rates. (See \"Derivative Financial Instruments\" in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 1, and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Note 12.)\nOur financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of debt instruments and interest rate swap contracts. The net market value of our debt instruments was $96,852 and $2,282 at January 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The debt instruments are subject to variable rate interest and therefore the market value is not sensitive to interest rate movements.\nThe interest rate swap contracts are entered into in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our underlying variable rate debt instruments. We employ separate swap transactions rather than fixed rate obligations to take advantage of the lower borrowing costs associated with floating rate debt while also eliminating possible risk related to refinancing in the fixed rate market.\nThe net market value of our interest rate swaps was $1,165 and $(114) at January 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. A 100-basis point increase in rates at January 31, 2000 and 1999 would result in an $861 and a $231 increase in the market value, respectively. A 100-basis point decrease in rates at January 31, 2000 and 1999 would result in an $878 and a $231 decrease in the market value, respectively.\nThe above sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100-basis point move in interest rates from their levels, with all other variables held constant. We calculate the market value of the interest rate swaps by utilizing a standard net present value model based on the market conditions as of the valuation date.\nWe use currency forwards and swaps to hedge anticipated cash flows in foreign currencies. The exposures currently hedged are the Canadian Dollar and the Euro. These financial instruments represent a net market value of $49 and $101 at January 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.\nTo monitor our currency exchange rate risk, we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on earnings in the case of a 10% devaluation of the Canadian Dollar and Euro to the US Dollar.\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from year-end levels, with all other variables being held constant. At January 31, 2000 and 1999, a 10% strengthening of the US Dollar versus the Canadian Dollar and the Euro would result in an increase of the net market value of the forwards and swaps of $178 and $201, respectively. At January 31, 2000 and 1999, a 10% weakening of the US Dollar versus the Canadian Dollar and the Euro would result in a decrease in the net market value of the forwards and swaps of $35 and $307, respectively.\nThe market value of the instruments was determined by taking into consideration the contracted interest rates and foreign exchange rates versus those available for similar maturities in the market at January 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.\nForeign exchange forwards and swap contracts are used to hedge our firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows. There is either a balance sheet or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary - ---------------\nThis Item 7A of the report provides quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio. We centrally manage our investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences, and overall financing strategies. Our investment portfolio includes fixed-income securities with a fair value of approximately $189.8 million at December 31, 2020. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and, based on our investment portfolio at December 31, 2020, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of $0.7 million. While an increase in interest rates may reduce the fair value of the investment portfolio, we will not realize the losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations unless the individual fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other-than-temporary.\nCurrency Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business on a worldwide basis and, as such, a portion of our revenues, earnings, and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates. The economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions, and other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies. Consequently, isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors.\nChanges in currency exchange rates could affect our foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted cash flows. We may enter into monthly forward derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating a portion of this risk.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. The Company's policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company's interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, the Company borrows at a combination of fixed and variable rates.\nIn 1998, the Company obtained the 1998 Second Amended Credit Facility, which provides for a maximum borrowing amount of up to $200 million. Borrowings under the 1998 Second Amended Credit Facility bear interest at variable market rates. At December 31, 2000, the Company's outstanding borrowings under the 1998 Second Amended Credit Facility were $113.5 million. The weighted average interest rate under the facility for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999 was 8.1% and 6.8% respectively. A .25% change in interest rates would have changed interest expense by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This change is based upon the weighted average borrowings under the 1998 Second Amended Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2000, which were $154.4 million.\nAt December 31, 2000, the Company also had outstanding bonds payable of $40.3 million, of which $40.0 million represents the principal balance of the bonds and the remaining $0.3 million represents unamortized premium.\nThe bonds bear interest at a fixed rate. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt, but not the earnings or cash flows of the Company. Changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt generally will not have a significant impact on the Company, unless the Company is required to refinance such debt. At December 31, 2000, the carrying value of the bonds approximated their fair value. On March 1, 2001, the Company redeemed the $40.0 million tax-exempt Massport Bonds, which had a 10.0% coupon. Proceeds for the redemption were derived from $37.1 million of tax-exempt and $5.4 million of taxable bonds, each having a 17-year maturity, bearing interest based on a weekly floating rate and having no principal reductions for the life of the bonds. Due to the nature of these bonds, they can be redeemed at any time without penalty. The new bonds are secured by letters of credit issued by GE Capital Corporation. The letters of credit are collateralized by the Harborside Hyatt Conference Center and Hotel. The excess proceeds of approximately $5,900 were used to pay down borrowings on the 1998 Second Amended Credit Facility.\nIn 1999, the Company entered into a $46.5 million mortgage loan (the \"1999 Mortgage Loan\"). The loan is subject to a fixed interest rate of 8.1%, matures on July 31, 2009 and requires interest and principal payments based on a 25-year amortization schedule. At December 31, 2000, the 1999 Mortgage Loan had a balance of $45.7 million. At December 31, 2000, the carrying value of the 1999 Mortgage Loan approximated its fair value.\nOn July 27, 2000, the Company entered into three ten-year mortgage loans totaling $74.5 million (the \"2000 Mortgage Loans\"). The loans are subject to a fixed interest rate of 8.08% and require interest and principal payments based on a 27-year amortization schedule. At December 31, 2000, the 2000 Mortgage Loans had a balance of $74.3 million. At December 31, 2000, the carrying value of the 2000 Mortgage Loans approximated its fair value.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and has a policy of managing this risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn general, we can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices, and that can affect the cost of operating, investing, and financing under those conditions. The Company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks. We assess market risk based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values, and cash flows based on a hypothetical change in these rates and prices.\nInterest Rate Risks\nOur primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility, since the interest is indexed to LIBOR. We entered into our current credit facility on May 3, 2019, and simultaneously terminated our previous credit facility. The applicable interest rate for the outstanding borrowings under our applicable credit facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.0625% and 3.3125%, respectively. Amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $15,579,000 and $22,670,000, respectively. An increase of 100-basis points in market interest rates would not cause a material effect on interest expense.\nForeign Currency Risks\nWhile we transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars and most of our revenues are collected in U.S. dollars, a portion of our revenues and operating costs are denominated in other currencies. Given the current political uncertainty surrounding the European Union and other economic uncertainties worldwide, changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect our sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses. For the year ending December 31, 2019, approximately 28% of our pro forma sales were denominated in foreign currencies (compared to 29% in the prior year), the most significant of which were the Euro, Canadian Dollar, Norwegian Kroner, and Swiss Franc. The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives. We have not held a material amount of foreign assets during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and do not believe our foreign assets expose us to a material foreign currency risk.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe employ a variety of practices to manage these market risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading. Derivatives are such that a specific debt instrument, contract, or anticipated purchase determines the amount, maturity, and other specifics of the hedge.

BUSINESS.\nGENERAL\nCentral Illinois Public Service Company (AmerenCIPS or the Registrant) is a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation (Ameren), a holding company which is registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. On December 31, 1997, CIPSCO Incorporated (CIPSCO) and Union Electric Company (AmerenUE) combined with the result that the common shareholders of CIPSCO and AmerenUE became the common shareholders of Ameren, and Ameren became the owner of 100% of the common stock of AmerenUE and CIPSCO's operating subsidiaries, the Registrant and CIPSCO Investment Company (the Merger). Since the Merger, Ameren has formed a number of other subsidiaries including AmerenEnergy Resources Company (Resources Company) which is a holding company for Ameren's nonregulated electric generation, related marketing and fuel procurement businesses and Ameren Services Company which provides shared support services to the Registrant. For additional information on the Registrant's business organization, see Note 1 to the \"Notes to Financial Statements\" under Item 8 herein.\nThe Registrant, an Illinois corporation, was organized in 1902. AmerenCIPS is a public utility operating company engaged in the sale of electricity and natural gas in portions of central and southern Illinois. The Registrant furnishes electric service in 557 incorporated and unincorporated communities and adjacent suburban and rural areas. The Registrant also furnishes natural gas service to retail customers in 267 incorporated and unincorporated communities and adjacent suburban and rural areas located in 41 counties of central and southern Illinois. The Registrant supplies electric service to about 325,000 customers and natural gas service to about 175,000 customers.\nThe AmerenCIPS service territory is predominantly made up of small towns and rural areas. The territory served by the Registrant, located in 66 counties in Illinois, has an estimated population of 820,000 and is devoted principally to agriculture and diversified industrial operations. Key industries include petroleum and petrochemical industries, food processing, metal fabrication and coal mining.\nIn conjunction with the Illinois Electric Service Customer Choice and Rate Relief Law of 1997, on May 1, 2000, following the receipt of all required state and federal regulatory approvals, the Registrant transferred all of its electric generating assets and related liabilities, at historical net book value, to a newly created nonregulated affiliate, AmerenEnergy Generating Company (Generating Company), a subsidiary of Resources Company (the Transfer). The Transfer was made in exchange for a subordinated promissory from Generating Company in the principal amount of $552 million and shares of Generating Company's common stock. The assets transferred by AmerenCIPS included the generating facilities located in Newton, Coffeen, Meredosia, Grand Tower and Hutsonville, Illinois as described under Item 2", "summary": "herein.\n\nAmerenCIPS is a public utility operating company engaged in the sale of electricity and natural gas in portions of central and southern Illinois.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments, among other strategies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations and one variable rate operating lease. We have used interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates. We enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations. Following is a summary of our interest rate swaps agreements at March 31, 2019:\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had $1,084.1 million of variable rate debt obligations. If the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate were to increase 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by $10.6 million annually (after consideration of the effect of the above derivative contracts). Certain senior mortgages have an anticipated repayment date and a maturity date. If these senior mortgages are not repaid by the anticipated repayment date the interest rate on these mortgages would increase from the current fixed rate. We are using the anticipated repayment date for our maturity schedule.\nAdditionally, our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 fixed income investment portfolios expose us to interest rate risk. This interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. As part of our insurance companies\u2019 asset and liability management, actuaries estimate the cash flow patterns of our existing liabilities to determine their duration. These outcomes are compared to the characteristics of the assets that are currently supporting these liabilities assisting management in determining an asset allocation strategy for future investments that management believes will mitigate the overall effect of interest rates.\nWe use derivatives to hedge our equity market exposure to indexed annuity products sold by our Life Insurance company. These contracts earn a return for the contractholder based on the change in the value of the S&P 500 index between annual index point dates. We buy and sell listed equity and index call options and call option spreads. The credit risk is with the party in which the options are written. The net option price is paid up front and there are no additional cash requirements or additional contingent liabilities. These contracts are held at fair market value on our balance sheet. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, these derivative hedges had a net market value of $1.5 million and $4.4 million, with notional amounts of $284.0 million and $227.4 million, respectively. These derivative instruments are included in Investments, other; on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAlthough the call options are employed to be effective hedges against our policyholder obligations from an economic standpoint, they do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP. Accordingly, the call options are marked to fair value on each reporting date with the change in fair value, plus or minus, included as a component of net investment and interest income. The change in fair value of the call options includes the gains or losses recognized at the expiration of the option term and the changes in fair value for open contracts.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our Canadian business. Approximately 4.6%, 4.6% and 4.4% of our revenue was generated in Canada in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The result of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would not be material to net income. We typically do not hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not considered material.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThis text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company's primary market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to changes in interest rates.\nForeign currency-Although the Company's functional currency is the United States dollar, a significant portion of the Company's net revenue is derived from its sales and operations outside the United States. In the future, the Company expects to continue to derive a significant portion of its net revenue and incur a significant portion of its operating costs outside the United States, and changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant, and potentially adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. For example, the Company estimates that the total adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes from the fourth quarter 1999 reduced the reported revenue for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2000 by approximately $60 million. Due to the large percentage of the Company's revenues derived outside of the United States, continuing strengthening of the United States Dollar would continue to have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations. The operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in foreign countries have been funded with investments and other advances. Due to the long-term nature of such investments and advances, the Company accounts for any adjustments resulting from translation as a charge or credit to \"accumulated other comprehensive loss\" within the stockholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. The Company historically has not engaged in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\nInterest rates-We are currently not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations because a substantial majority of our long-term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates. However, we are exposed to interest rate risk as additional financing may be required due to the large operating losses and capital expenditures associated with establishing and expanding our networks and facilities. The interest rates that we will be able to obtain on additional financing, if any, will depend on market conditions at that time, and may differ from the rates we have secured on our current debt. We do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and/or similar instruments. The estimated fair value of the Company's 2000 Convertible Debentures, 1999, 1998 and 1997 Senior Notes (carrying value of $1,109 million), based on quoted market prices, at December 31, 2000 was $285 million.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nHEDGES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into and may in the future enter into arrangements to hedge our oil and natural gas production, whereby gains and losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity. The hedges that we have entered into generally provide a 'floor' or 'cap and floor' on the prices paid for our oil and natural gas production over a period of time. Hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including the following:\no our production does not meet the minimum production requirements under the agreement;\no the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations; or\no there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received.\nDue to our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, we believe that the use of such derivative instruments does not expose us to material risk, however, the use of derivative instruments for the hedging activities could affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. The use of such instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, but it may also limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements.\nOur hedging strategy is designed to provide protection from low commodity prices while providing some opportunity to enjoy the benefits of higher commodity prices. We have a series of natural gas futures contracts with Bank of Montreal and with an affiliate of Enron. This strategy is designed to provide a degree of protection of negative shifts in natural gas prices as reported on the Henry Hub Nymex Index on approximately 73% of our expected natural gas production from reserves currently classified as proved developed producing during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001. At the same time, we are able to participate completely in upward movements in the Henry Hub Nymex Index to the extent of approximately 76% of our expected natural gas production for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001.\nIn addition to our natural gas hedging agreements, at June 30, 2000, we have a contract on 5,000 barrels of oil per month involving floor and ceiling prices of $22.00 and $28.63 per barrel, respectively, from July 1 through December 31, 2000.\nAs of June 30, 2000 the fair value of our hedging contracts, measured as the estimated cost we would incur to terminate the arrangements, was $5.3 million. As of June 30, 2000 a 10% increase in oil and natural gas prices would have resulted in an unfavorable change of $2.0 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts and a 10% decrease in oil and natural gas prices would have resulted in a favorable change of $2.1 million in the fair value of our hedging contracts.\nINTEREST RATES\nAt June 30, 2000, our exposure to interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement. As of June 30, 2000, we are not using any derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Interest is payable on borrowings under the credit agreement based on a floating rate. If short-term interest rates average 10% higher during our fiscal year 2001 than they were during 2000, our interest expense would increase by approximately $213,000. This amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change of 10% to our outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement at June 30, 2000.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the use of hedging instruments to reduce exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas.

Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time to maximize income. Management realizes certain risks are inherent and that the goal is to identify and minimize the risks. The Company's exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Asset/Liability committee. Tools used by management include an interest rate shock analysis and to a lesser extent, the standard GAP report. The Company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes and is not currently engaged in transactions involving derivative financial instruments.

The Company estimates that it could sell a majority of its loans at a premium of between 0.0% and 3.0%.\n(4)Fair value of the Company's fixed maturity deposits is estimated using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.\n(5)Fair value of borrowings from the State of California and term borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text provides information about the Company's market risk, which is primarily interest rate risk.

Interest rate changes on our fixed rate debt will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps. To the extent we enter into such derivative financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, it does not possess credit risk. It is our policy to enter into these transactions with what we believe are high quality counterparties, including those with whom we have a lending relationship. We believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty non-performance is remote.

We have not entered into any hedge arrangements, commodity swap agreements, commodity futures, options or other derivative financial instruments. We also conduct business in Canada, which subjects our results of operations and cash flows to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nConcentration of Credit Risk. Our principal market risks include fluctuations in commodity prices, which affect demand for and pricing of our services, and the risk related to the concentration of our clients in the oil and natural gas industry. Since all of our clients are involved in the oil and natural gas industry, there may be a positive or negative effect on our exposure to credit risk because our clients may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. As an example, changes to existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers or our clients. In the normal course of business, we provide credit terms to our clients. Accordingly, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain allowances for possible losses. Our historical experience supports our allowance for doubtful accounts of $250,000 at December 31, 2019. This does not necessarily indicate that it would be adequate to cover a payment default by one large or several smaller clients.\nWe generally provide services to certain key clients that account for a significant percentage of our accounts receivable at any given time. Our key clients vary over time. We extend credit to various companies in the oil and natural gas industry, including our key clients, for the acquisition of seismic data, which results in a concentration of credit risk. This concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in the economic or other conditions of our key clients and may accordingly impact our overall credit risk. If any of these significant clients were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, or for\nany other reason, our results of operations could be affected. Because of the nature of our contracts and clients\u2019 projects, our largest clients can change from year to year, and the largest clients in any year may not be indicative of the largest clients in any subsequent year. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our four largest clients accounted for approximately 60% of revenue. The remaining balance of our revenue derived from varied clients and none represented more than 10% of revenue.\nInterest Rate Risk. From time to time, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on the outstanding indebtedness under our Loan Agreement.\nWe generally have cash in the bank which exceeds federally insured limits. Historically, we have not experienced any losses in such accounts; however, volatility in financial markets may impact our credit risk on cash and short-term investments. At December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents totaled $26,271,000.\nFor further information, see \u201cItem 7.

{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn August 10, 2018, we, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer received a Wells notice from the enforcement division staff of the Miami Regional Office of the SEC in connection with an investigation into the accuracy of certain statements in our Form 10 registration statement filed June 2, 2016, as amended, and our Form 10-K annual report filed May 8, 2017. The staff\u2019s inquiry was focused on our disclosure language in those filings relating to the FDA requirements for our consumer transdermal patch products in that our filings did not accurately reflect the FDA\u2019s jurisdiction over our consumer products and did not disclose that we could not legally market these products in the United States. On September 7, 2018, we and the officers filed a Wells submission in response. After engaging in settlement discussions with the staff about the matters under investigation, the Company and the officers submitted an offer of settlement to resolve the investigation without admitting or denying any violations of the federal securities laws.\nOn December 26, 2018, the SEC announced that it has accepted the settlement offer and instituted settled administrative cease-and-desist proceedings against us and the named officers. The SEC\u2019s administrative order, dated December 26, 2018, finds that we and the officers consented - without admitting or denying any findings by the SEC- to cease-and-desist orders against them for violations by us of Sections 12(g) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act 1934 and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, which require issuers to file accurate registration statements and annual reports with the SEC; violations by the officers for causing our violations of the above issuer reporting provisions; and violations by the officers of Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, which requires each principal executive and principal financial officer of issuers to attest that annual reports filed with the SEC do not contain any untrue statements of material fact. In addition to consenting to the cease-and-desist orders, the officers have each agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty to resolve the investigation. The administrative order does not impose a civil penalty or any other monetary relief against us.\nOn July 27, 2018, we commenced an action in the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida, against Advanced Health Brands, Inc., Raymond Kalmar, Paul Murphy, Michelle Polly-Murphy, Laura Fillman and John Baker, together with a Motion for Temporary Injunction Without Notice and a Motion for Prejudgment Writ of Replevin arising from our decision to seek to rescind for misrepresentation the agreement by which we acquired Advanced Health Brands, Inc. for 5,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $2,500,000 and seek return of the shares. On August 2, 2018, the court entered a Temporary Injunction Without Notice and an Order to Show Cause against the defendants. Defendants Kalmar, Murphy, Polly-Murphy, and Baker have filed a Motion to Dismiss our Verified Complaint, Motion to Dissolve Temporary Injunction Without Notice and Response to Order to Show Cause, and Motion to Compel Arbitration. On January 4, 2019, the court dismissed our complaint with prejudice, but directed the defendants to assign to us, within 30 days, the six patent applications never duly transferred to us. On February 1, 2019, we appealed the court\u2019s order. Pursuant to a settlement agreement, one of the defendants has returned the 200,000 shares which had been issued to her, and the shares have been canceled.\nOn August 22, 2018, Defendants Kalmar, Murphy, Polly-Murphy and Baker filed a complaint against us in the Franklin County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaratory judgment permitting them to sell the shares of common stock they received pursuant to the acquisition agreement. The parties have agreed to a stay pending the outcome of the Florida litigation.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nThe SEC has accepted a settlement offer from the Company and its officers in connection with an investigation into the accuracy of certain statements in the Company's Form 10 registration statement and Form 10-K annual report.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below. Our market risk discussion includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments.\nWe borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and bank term loans bear interest at variable rates. Our long-term debt, which consists of secured and unsecured long-term financings, typically bears interest at fixed rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit generally the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars, swaps, caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to existing and prospective debt instruments. We generally do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $2,035.7 million principal amount of fixed rate debt outstanding, a $747.7 million increase as compared to December 31, 2018, excluding debt with a variable rate that is effectively fixed by related interest rate hedge contracts. The estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt was $2,107.1 million. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher, the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt would have been $125.7 million lower. If interest rates had been 100 basis points lower, the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt would have been $136.8 million higher.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $471.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding, a $61.0 million decrease as compared to December 31, 2018, not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. If the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher or lower, the annual interest expense at December 31, 2019 would increase or decrease by $4.7 million.\nSee \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.\"\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $50.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding with $50.0 million of related floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These swaps effectively fix the underlying one-month LIBOR rate at a weighted average rate of 1.693%. If the underlying LIBOR interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the aggregate fair market value of the swaps at December 31, 2019 would increase or decrease by $1.0 million.\nWe are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, which are major financial institutions, under the swaps. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our counterparties using publicly available information. Based on this review, we currently expect the counterparties to perform fully under the swaps. However, if a counterparty defaults on its obligations under a swap, we could be required to pay the full rates on the applicable debt, even if such rates were in excess of the rate in the contract.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThis text provides a summary of the market risk disclosures of a company.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nThe primary market risk to which the Company is exposed is interest rate risk, which is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the Company. Changes in the general level of interest rates between the time when the Company originates or purchases mortgage loans and the time when the Company sells such mortgage loans at securitization can affect the value of the Company's mortgage loans held for sale and, consequently, the Company's net gain on sale revenue by affecting the \"excess spread\" between the interest rate on the mortgage loans and the interest rate paid to asset-backed investors who purchase pass-through certificates issued by the securitization trusts. If interest rates rise between the time the Company originates or purchases the loans and the time the loans are sold at securitization, the excess spread generally narrows, resulting in a loss in value of the loans and a lower net gain on sale reported by the Company.\nA hypothetical 10 basis point increase in interest rates, which historically has resulted in approximately a 10 basis point decrease in the excess spread, would be expected to reduce the Company's net gain on sale by approximately 25 basis points. Many factors, however, can affect the sensitivity analysis described above including, without limitation, the structure and credit enhancement used in a particular securitization, the Company's prepayment, loss and discount rate assumptions, and the spread over treasuries demanded by asset-backed investors who purchase the Companies asset-backed securities.\nTo reduce its financial exposure to changes in interest rates, the Company generally hedges its mortgage loans held for sale by entering into treasury rate lock contracts (see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Hedging\"). The Company's hedging strategy has largely been an effective tool to manage the Company's interest rate risk on loans prior to securitization, by providing the Company with a cash gain (or loss) to largely offset the reduced (increase) excess spread (and resultant lower (or higher) net gain on sale) from an increase (decrease) in interest rates. A hedge may not, however, perform its intended purpose of offsetting changes in net gain on sale. This was the case in the third quarter of 1998, when asset-backed investors, responding to lower treasury yields and global financial market volatility, demanded substantially wider spreads over treasuries than historically experienced for newly issued asset-backed securities. As a result, Delta's $8.8 million hedge loss resulting from lower interest rates was not offset by a higher gain on sale as the Company has historically seen.\nChanges in interest rates could also adversely affect the Company's ability to purchase and originate loans and/or could affect the level of loan prepayments thereby impacting the size of the Company's loan servicing portfolio and the value of the Company's interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights. (See \"Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Interest Rate Risk\").\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nDelta Financial Corporation is exposed to market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates. These risks are highly sensitive to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. We are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates. Our primary interest rate exposures relate to our lease agreements, floating rate debt obligations and interest rate derivatives. Rent payments under our aircraft lease agreements typically do not vary during the term of the lease according to changes in interest rates. However, our borrowing agreements generally require payments based on a variable interest rate index, such as LIBOR. Therefore, to the extent our borrowing costs are not fixed, increases in interest rates may reduce our net income by increasing the cost of our debt without any corresponding increase in rents or cash flow from our securities.\nChanges in interest rates may also impact our net book value as our interest rate derivatives are periodically marked-to-market through shareholders\u2019 equity. Generally, we are exposed to loss on our fixed pay interest rate derivatives to the extent interest rates decrease below their contractual fixed rate.\nThe relationship between spreads on derivative instruments may vary from time to time, resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decrease. Changes in the general level of interest rates can also affect our ability to acquire new investments and our ability to realize gains from the settlement of such assets.\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates is based on a sensitivity analysis, which models the effects of hypothetical interest rate shifts on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe a sensitivity analysis provides the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, it is constrained by several factors, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by the inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled.\nAlthough the following results of a sensitivity analysis for changes in interest rates may have some limited use as a benchmark, they should not be viewed as a forecast. This forward-looking disclosure also is selective in nature and addresses only the potential interest expense impacts on our financial instruments and, in particular, does not address the mark-to-market impact on our interest rate derivatives. It also does not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of changes in interest rates.\nA hypothetical 100-basis point increase/decrease in our variable interest rates would increase/decrease the minimum contracted rentals on our portfolio as of December 31, 2019 by $4.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively, over the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 100-basis point increase/decrease in our variable interest rate on our borrowings would result in an interest expense increase/decrease of $4.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively, net of amounts received from our interest rate derivatives, over the next twelve months. We have an interest rate cap to hedge approximately 70% of our floating rate interest exposure which is set at 2% and has a current notional balance of $245.0 million and reduces over time to $215.0 million. The cap matures in September 2021.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk associated with changes in interest rates and how it affects the company's financial condition and results of operations.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nIn the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values that can affect the cost of operating and financing. Accordingly, we address a portion of these risks through a program of risk management.\nInterest Rate Risk: Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from the SSRCF\u2019s various floating rate pricing mechanisms. If interest rates were to increase 100 basis points (1 percent) from the weighted-average interest rate of 2.6% at December 31, 2019, and assuming no changes in the $119.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the SSRCF at December 31, 2019, our additional annual expense would be approximately $1.2 million on a pre-tax basis. For future quarters, we expect that the interest expense will increase as a result of our $450.0 million in borrowings under a new term loan on July 1, 2019 in connection with the closing of the AXC acquisition.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk: We operate in the United States and other foreign countries, which creates exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business, which can impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, and competitive position. The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into their U.S. dollar equivalents at end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities, while income and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are components of other comprehensive (loss) income as reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Translation exposure is primarily with the euro, the Czech koruna, the Chinese yuan, and the Japanese yen. During 2019, both the Chinese yuan and euro decreased in relation to the U.S. dollar by less than 2%. At December 31, 2019, a hypothetical further 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would not materially affect our financial statements.\nTransaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the consolidated statements of income as a component of foreign currency loss. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge anticipated and firmly committed foreign currency transactions. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The terms of the contracts are generally one year or less. At December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would not materially affect our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts.\nMarket Price Sensitive Instruments\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2024 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the \u201cNote Hedge Transactions\u201d) with certain parties, including affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 2024 Notes (the \u201cOption Counterparties\u201d). These Note Hedge Transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any future conversion the 2024 Notes.\nWe also entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties to acquire up to 4.41 million shares of our common stock. The warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock to the extent that the price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants unless we elect, subject to certain conditions, to settle the warrants in cash. The strike price of the warrant transactions related to the 2024 Notes was initially $71.775 per share.

We do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings under our bank lines of credit. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility.\nImportance of International Markets\nInternational markets provide us with significant growth opportunities. Our financial results in future periods could, however, be adversely affected by periodic economic downturns in different regions of the world, changes in trade policies or tariffs, civil or military conflict and other political instability. We monitor economic and currency conditions around the world to evaluate whether there may be any significant effect on our international sales in the future. Due to our overseas investments and the necessity of dealing with local currencies in our foreign business transactions, we are at risk with respect to foreign currency fluctuations.\nForeign Currency\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including from foreign currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We conduct business in more than 20 countries. We closely monitor our operations in each country in which we do business and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Weaknesses in the currencies of some of the countries in which we do business are often offset by strengths in other currencies. Foreign currency financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end rates, except that revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average rates during the reporting period. We include gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions in income, while we exclude those resulting from translation of financial statements from income and include them as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses, which were included in our consolidated statement of operations, amounted to a gain (loss) of approximately $2.0 million, $(1.3) million, and $0.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would have resulted in a net increase in our operating income of approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2019. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would have resulted in a net decrease in our operating income of approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2019.\nInflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe principal maturity and estimated value of our long-term debt exposure for each of the fiscal years set forth below as of June 30, 2019 were as follows (in thousands):\nAt June 30, 2019, we had $88.0 million of borrowing outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

We manufactured, among other things, rubber coated asbestos sheet gasket materials from 1914 through 1973 and aircraft brake assemblies containing asbestos materials prior to 1987. Some of the claimants are independent contractors or their employees who allege exposure to asbestos while working at certain of our facilities. It is expected that in a substantial portion of these cases there will be no evidence of exposure to a Goodyear manufactured product containing asbestos or asbestos in our facilities. The amount expended by us and our insurers on defense and claim resolution was approximately $22 million during 2019. The plaintiffs in the pending cases allege that they were exposed to asbestos and, as a result of such exposure, suffer from various respiratory diseases, including in some cases mesothelioma and lung cancer. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified actual and punitive damages and other relief.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAt various times, we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to Note 14, \"Derivatives.\"\nCurrency exchange rate risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nOur operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenue, third-party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as described above to substantially mitigate our currency risk. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 74 percent, 76 percent and 71 percent of our revenues were generated in U.S. dollars.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nInterest rate risk\nAs of October 31, 2019, we had $1.8 billion in principal amount of senior debt outstanding. The carrying amount of the fixed-rate senior notes was $1.8 billion, and the related fair value based on quoted prices was $1.9 billion. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the company\u2019s fixed-rate long-term debt but not the company\u2019s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.\nAs of October 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company\u2019s fixed-rate long-term debt by approximately $33 million. However, since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity nor do the investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company\u2019s fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the company\u2019s results of operations or stockholders\u2019 equity.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to risks from adverse fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices. We have historically managed commodity price risks through commodity derivatives. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. The extent to which we use derivative instruments is dependent upon our access to them in the financial markets, the costs associated with entering into such arrangements and our use of other risk management methods, such as establishing sales arrangements that permit the pass-through of changes in commodity prices to customers. Our objective in managing our exposure to market risk is to limit the impact on earnings and cash flow.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had significant debt commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2019. These on-balance sheet financial instruments, to the extent they accrue interest at variable interest rates, expose us to interest rate risk. Prior to our Corporate Reorganization and IPO, our interest rate risk arose primarily on significant borrowings that were drawn under our portion of the RGHL Group Credit Agreement and certain related party borrowings.\nIn conjunction with our Corporate Reorganization and IPO all of our obligations under the historical debt commitments, both those with third party financial institutions and those with RGHL Group, have been settled. Based on the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility as of the closing of our IPO with all other variables remaining constant, a 100-basis point increase (decrease) in the interest rates under the Term Loan Facility would result in a $25 million increase (decrease) in interest expense, per annum, on our borrowings.\nCommodity Risk\nWe are exposed to commodity and other price risk principally from the purchase of resin, aluminum, natural gas, electricity, carton board and diesel. We use various strategies to manage cost exposures on certain material purchases with the objective of obtaining more predictable costs for these commodities. From time to time, we enter into hedging agreements, including commodity derivative contracts, to hedge commodity prices primarily related to aluminum, diesel and benzene.\nWe enter into futures and swaps to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. These derivatives are implemented to either (a) mitigate the impact of the lag in timing between when material costs change and when we can pass through these material cost changes to our customers or (b) fix our input costs for a period. The following table provides the details of our outstanding commodity derivative contracts as of December 31, 2019.\nCommodity derivative contracts are valued using observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair values of the outstanding commodity derivative contracts were a net asset of less than $1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a $9 million unrealized gain and a $9 million realized loss in cost of sales in the combined statement of income related to commodity derivatives.\nA 10% upward (downward) movement in the price curve used to value the commodity derivative contracts, applied as of December 31, 2019, would have resulted in an increase (decrease) of less than $1 million in unrealized gains recognized in the combined statements of income assuming all other variables remain constant.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis text discusses the market risks faced by a company, including interest rate risk and commodity risk.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary objectives of our investment strategy are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields. To minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest mainly in cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including money market funds, U.S. Treasury debt and corporate debt securities. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we believe that we have no material exposure to interest rate risk.\nMarket Price Sensitive Instruments\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt related to our convertible senior notes recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of $887.9 million, net of unamortized discount and issuance costs totaling $314.6 million. Changes in the fair value of our outstanding debt, which could be impacted by changes in interest rates, are not recorded in these consolidated financial statements as the debt is accounted for at cost less unamortized discount and issuance costs. The fair value of the debt, which was $1.35 billion as of December 31, 2019, is also impacted by changes in our stock price.\nIn order to reduce potential equity dilution, in connection with the issuance of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.375% Notes, we entered into capped call options \u201cCapped Calls\u201d. We expect the Capped Calls to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event the conversion is settled in cash, to provide a source of cash to settle a portion of our cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion our stock price exceeds the conversion price under the 0.375% Notes. The Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $335.90 per share and cover 3.5 million shares of common stock.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nForeign currency risk arises from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in non-U.S. countries. Such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. Approximately 34% of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies for the year ended December 31, 2019. As our business in regions outside of the United States continues to increase, we will be increasingly exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations. The cost of revenue related to revenue generated outside of the United States is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars; however, operating costs related to these revenues are largely denominated in the same respective currencies, thereby partially limiting our transaction risk exposure. Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British Pound and Canadian Dollar, could adversely affect our financial results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities.\nWe have intercompany receivables and payables from our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, principally the Euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. Fluctuations from the beginning to the end of a reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency-denominated intercompany receivables and payables, generating currency translation gains or losses. Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions are included in interest and other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations and amounted to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A. provides quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, including interest rate risk, market price sensitive instruments, and foreign currency exchange risk.

{"section": "ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows. We are exposed to the market risks described below.\nInterest Rate Risk. The nature of our business exposes us to market risk arising from changes in interest rates to which our variable-rate debt is linked. In July 2020, we entered into a five-year interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $500.0 million of variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount based on one-month LIBOR and pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 0.29%. Any changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to net interest expense as they are realized.\nApproximately 83% of our debt is either fixed or hedged using derivative instruments, which helps mitigate the impact of changes in short-term interest rates. However, a 1.0% increase or decrease in the interest rates on our unhedged debt would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $3.0 million in interest expense over the next 12 months, based on December 31, 2020 levels.\nThis analysis does not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could impact interest rates. Further, in the event of an increase in interest rates of significant magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk. Although we have significant foreign-based operations, the U.S. dollar is our primary operating currency. Thus, most of our revenue and expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars. We have equipment sales in British Pound Sterling, Euros and Japanese Yen and incur overhead costs in foreign currencies, primarily in British Pound Sterling and Euros. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the U.S. Dollar decreased in value in relation to other major foreign currencies (such as the Euro and British Pound Sterling). The decrease in the relative value of the U.S. Dollar has increased our revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The associated increase in the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. Dollar has also caused assets held at some of our foreign subsidiaries to increase in value when translated to U.S. Dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a gain on foreign exchange of $0.7 million. A 10% change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nITEM 8:", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks faced by the company, including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe have exposure to a variety of market risks, including the effects of interest rates, fuel prices, and foreign exchange rates.\nInterest Rates\nTo provide adequate funding through seasonal business cycles and minimize overall borrowing costs, we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate financial instruments with varying maturities. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 19% of our outstanding debt at fixed rates.\nThe table below provides information regarding the weighted average effective interest rates on our fixed-rate debt as of December 31, 2020.\nA significant portion of the outstanding variable rate debt is currently determined by various LIBOR rates subject to a floor of 1.0% plus fixed margins ranging from 3.5% to 7.5%. Based on a 3-month LIBOR, a 100 basis point change in the interest rates that applied during the year to our variable rate long-term debt would not have a material impact to either our interest expense or our net income (loss) before taxes. Our evaluation of this exposure included consideration of relevant circumstances, inclusive of the 1.0% floor.\nWe expect that the LIBOR rate will be discontinued during 2021 and will utilize a suitable replacement rate as outlined in our debt agreements. We do not believe that the discontinuation of LIBOR as a reference rate in our debt agreements will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense.\nFuel Prices\nThe Company currently has fuel surcharge programs in place. These programs are well established within the industry and customer acceptance of fuel surcharges remains high. Since the amount of fuel surcharge is generally based on average, national diesel fuel prices and is reset weekly, our exposure to fuel price volatility is reduced. In general, under our present fuel surcharge programs, we believe that while rising fuel prices are beneficial to us and falling fuel prices are detrimental to us in the short term, the effects are mitigated over time. We cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuel-price increases.\nForeign Exchange Rates\nRevenue, operating expenses, assets and liabilities of our Canadian operations are often denominated in local currency, thereby creating limited exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. The risks related to foreign currency exchange rates are not significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary:\nThe Company has exposure to a variety of market risks, including the effects of interest rates, fuel prices, and foreign exchange rates. 19% of the Company's outstanding debt is at fixed rates, and a significant portion of the variable rate debt is determined by LIBOR rates subject to a floor of 1.0%.

{"section": "ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in legal proceedings from time to time. As of the date hereof, except as set forth herein, there are no known legal proceedings against the Company. No governmental agency has instituted proceedings, served, or threatened the Company with any complaints.\nOn March 26, 2019, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, as well as four of its current directors, styled Heng Ren Silk Road Investments LLC, Heng Ren Investments LP, derivatively on behalf of Sino Agro Food Inc. v. Sino Agro Food Inc., Lee Yip Kun Solomon, Tan Poay Teik, Chen Bor Hann, Lim Chang Soh, and Sino Agro Food Inc., as the nominal defendant (Case No.: 1:19-cv-02680) (the \u201cComplaint\u201d). No hearings have been scheduled as of the date hereof.\nThe Complaint alleges violations of securities laws and state law, breaches of fiduciary duties (including gross mismanagement of the Company) by the individual defendants, a material default of its obligations under a commercial loan agreement, misleading and false statements (including material omissions) by the individual defendants, and unauthorized issuance of new shares of Common Stock to pay debts that, in the view of the plaintiffs, has diluted shareholder ownership and oppressed shareholders of the Company (the litigated claims). The Company and the individual defendants believe that these claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the Complaint. Based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the facts underlying the claims, the uncertainty of litigation, and the preliminary stage of the case, the Company cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from this action. However, an unfavorable outcome may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn July 23, 2020, the Court issued an Order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) preliminarily approving settlement, authorizing notice and scheduling the settlement hearing for the Complaint. Under the terms of the Order, among other things, within 10 calendar days of the Order (i) the Company shall provide notice of the Settlement by filing with the SEC a Form 8-K, which shall include as exhibits (A) the Notice of Proposed Settlement of Shareholder Derivative Litigation (the \u201cNotice\u201d) and (B) the Settlement, (ii) counsel for the Plaintiffs shall file the Notice via a national wire service and (iii) the Company shall make available on its corporate website the Form 8-K and exhibits for the time period set forth in the Order. In addition, the Order scheduled a settlement hearing for October 13, 2020 to consider whether to grant final approval to the Settlement. The Settlement contains no admission of wrongdoing. The Company has always maintained and continues to believe that it did not engage in any wrongdoing or otherwise commit any violation of federal or state securities laws or other laws.\n- 40 -\nOn October 13th 2020, the Court granted the final approval to the Settlement of Shareholder Derivative Litigation and dismissed the Shareholder Derivative Litigation with prejudice. The Court found that the terms of the settlement are fair, reasonable and adequate as to each of the parties, and hereby approved the Settlement in all respects and as of October 13th 2020 SIAF, Lee Solomon Yip Kun, Tan Poay Teil, Chen Bor Hann and Lim Chang Soh have, fully, finally and forever released, relinquished, discharged and dismissed with prejudice from the litigated claims.\nITEM 4", "summary": "On March 26, 2019, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and four of its current directors.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks, which include significant deterioration of the U.S. and foreign markets, changes in U.S. interest rates, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the effects of economic uncertainty which may affect the prices we pay our vendors in the foreign countries in which we do business. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur revolver and our term loan each have a variable interest rate which, when drawn upon, subjects us to risks associated with changes in that interest rate. As of February 2, 2020, we had $300,000,000 outstanding under the term loan, and during fiscal 2019 we had borrowings of $100,000,000 under the revolver, all of which were repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. A hypothetical increase or decrease of one percentage point on our existing variable rate debt instruments would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flows. See Note P: Subsequent Events to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short-term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents, which are also affected by changes in market interest rates. As of February 2, 2020, our investments, made primarily in interest bearing demand deposit accounts and money market funds, are stated at cost and approximate their fair values.\nForeign Currency Risks\nWe purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the U.S. in transactions that are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as such, any foreign currency impact related to these international purchase transactions was not significant to us during fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018. Since we pay for the majority of our international purchases in U.S. dollars, however, a decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies would subject us to risks associated with increased purchasing costs from our vendors in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation. We cannot predict with certainty the effect these increased costs may have on our financial statements or results of operations.\nIn addition, our retail and e-commerce\nbusinesses in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, and our operations throughout Asia and Europe, expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Substantially all of our purchases and sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, which limits our exposure to this risk. However, some of our foreign operations have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. While the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was not material to us in fiscal 2019, we have continued to see volatility in the exchange rates in the countries in which we do business. As we continue to expand globally, the foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations may increase. To mitigate this risk, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure with foreign currency forward contracts in accordance with our risk management policies (see Note L to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risks that the company is exposed to, such as significant deterioration of the U.S. and foreign markets, changes in U.S. interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nForeign Currency Exchange Risks\nWe transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, intercompany transactions and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. We do not, and do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their respective fair values.\nThe forward contracts (both those that are designated and not designated as accounting hedging instruments) will generally expire in less than three months, with 12 months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding as of August 31, 2019. The change in fair value related to contracts designated as accounting hedging instruments is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to the revenue or expense line in which the underlying transaction occurs within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The change in fair value related to contracts not designated as accounting hedging instruments will be reflected in cost of revenue within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The forward contracts are primarily denominated in Chinese yuan renminbi, Euros and Mexican pesos.\nBased on our overall currency rate exposures as of August 31, 2019, including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, an immediate 10% hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 13 - \u201cDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk includes changes in interest rates that could affect the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on variable rate borrowings under the 2017 Credit Facility and 2018 Credit Facility. There were $804.9 million in borrowings outstanding under debt facilities with variable interest rates as of August 31, 2019. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Note 8 - \u201cNotes Payable and Long-Term Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations.\nTo manage our exposure to market risk, we use derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate. In connection with our variable interest rate debt, we have interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of $200.0 million and $350.0 million, which expire on August 31, 2020 and August 24, 2020, respectively. See Note 13 - \u201cDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our interest rate swap transactions. We do not, and do not intend to, use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nWe utilize valuation models to estimate the effects of sudden interest rate changes. The impact of a hypothetical change of 10.0% in variable interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately $4.2 million for fiscal year 2020.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk discusses the company's exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate risk.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket Risk\n\u2022Foreign Currency Risk\nOur financial results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we operate. Our primary overseas markets are in Europe and Asia, thus exposing us to exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the euro, the Chinese renminbi and certain other currencies used in Asia. We seek to mitigate exposure to variability in currency exchange rates, when possible, through the use of natural hedges, whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another. We further seek to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties when the use of natural hedges is not possible or desirable. We currently do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We monitor foreign exchange risks and at times manage such risks on specific transactions. Our risk management process primarily uses analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis. In 2020, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies would have resulted in a decrease to net sales and net income of approximately $32 million and $7 million, respectively, while a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies would have resulted in an increase to net sales and net income of approximately $39 million and $7 million, respectively.\n\u2022Interest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $25.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The interest charged on these borrowings fluctuates with movements in the benchmark LIBOR. As of December 31, 2020, the effective all-in rate of interest on our revolving credit facility was 1.77%, and a 100 basis point increase in LIBOR would have increased the amount of interest expense by approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Commodity Risk\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our materials and products. In particular, we are exposed to market fluctuations in commodity pricing as we utilize certain materials, such as copper and ceramic, which are key materials in certain of our products. In order to minimize the risk of market driven price changes in these commodities, we utilize hedging strategies to insulate us against price fluctuations of copper, the most frequently used commodity in our manufacturing processes. We currently do not use hedging strategies to minimize the risk of price fluctuations on other commodity-based raw materials; however, we regularly review such strategies to hedge market risk on an ongoing basis.\nFor additional discussion, refer to \u201cNote 2 - Fair Value Measurements\u201d and \u201cNote 3 - Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments\u201d to \u201cItem 8.", "summary": "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nMarket risk is the risk to our earnings and/or financial position resulting from adverse changes in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices. Our exposure to market risk is primarily interest rate risk (\u201cIRR\u201d), which arises from our lending, investing and deposit gathering activities. Our market risk sensitive instruments consist of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, none of which are entered into for trading purposes. During the normal course of business, we are not exposed to foreign exchange risk or commodity price risk. Our exposure to IRR can be explained as the potential for change in reported earnings and/or the market value of net worth. Variations in interest rates affect the underlying economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. These changes arise because the present value of future cash flows, and often the cash flows themselves, change with interest rates. The effects of the changes in these present values reflect the change in our underlying economic value, and provide a basis for the expected change in future earnings related to interest rates. Interest rate changes affect earnings by changing net interest income and the level of other interest-sensitive income and operating expenses. IRR is inherent in the role of banks as financial intermediaries.\nA bank with a high degree of IRR may experience lower earnings, impaired liquidity and capital positions, and most likely, a greater risk of insolvency. Therefore, banks must carefully evaluate IRR to promote safety and soundness in their activities.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, FOMC started decreasing the target federal funds rate, eventually cutting the rate by a total of 75 basis points to set the new target range of 1.50 percent to 1.75percent at year end. The FOMC judges the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, and will continue to monitor the implications of incoming data for economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. The FOMC noted determination of the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate will be its assessment of the realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment and inflation objectives.\nThe projected impact of instantaneous changes in interest rates on our net interest income and economic value of equity at December 31, 2019, based on our simulation model, is summarized as follows:\nOur simulation model creates pro forma net interest income scenarios under various interest rate shocks. Given instantaneous and parallel shifts in general market rates of plus 100 basis points, our projected net interest income for the 12 months ending December 31, 2019, would decrease at 0.9 percent from model results using current interest rates. Additional disclosures about market risk are included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the heading \u201cMarket Risk Sensitivity,\u201d and are incorporated into this Item 7A by reference.\nThe Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") has proposed that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\") replace USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed that the transition to SOFR from USD-LIBOR will take place by the end of 2021. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR. Industry organizations are currently working on the transition plan. The Company is currently monitoring this activity and evaluating the risks involved.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A. provides a summary of the bank's exposure to market risk, specifically interest rate risk. It explains that the bank is exposed to this risk through its lending, investing and deposit gathering activities, and that changes in interest rates can affect the underlying economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. It also notes that the bank is not exposed to foreign exchange risk or commodity price risk. The bank has a simulation model to project the impact of instantaneous changes in interest rates on its net interest income and economic value of equity. Finally, the bank is monitoring the transition from USD-LIBOR to SOFR and evaluating the risks involved."}
{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nThe following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We deposit our excess cash in what we believe are high-quality financial instruments, primarily money market funds and certificates of deposit and, we may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. We do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our marketable securities; however, such risk is mitigated by the relatively short-term nature of these investments. These investments are denominated in United States dollars.\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations, while at the same time maximizing the income, we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments in a variety of securities, which could include commercial paper, money market funds and corporate and government debt securities. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were invested in liquid money market accounts, certificates of deposit and government securities. All market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe are exposed to translation risk because certain of our foreign operations utilize the local currency as their functional currency and those financial results must be translated into U.S. dollars. As currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of the financial statements of foreign businesses into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of financial results between years.\nWe do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities. Although our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate, make sales and buy materials and services. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency transaction risk. Further, changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could affect our future net sales, cost of sales and expenses and could result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses.\nWe cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and hedging activities may be considered if appropriate.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, and our revolving credit facility. A hypothetical 100 basis point movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents outstanding at December 31, 2019 would increase interest income by approximately $0.4 million on an annual basis. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the arithmetic average of the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period (one, three or six months (or 12 months if agreed to by all applicable Lenders)) as selected by us relevant to such borrowing plus the applicable margin, or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the prime commercial lending rate as determined by the Agent, and the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin and subject to a floor of 0.00%. We did not have any borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2019.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "Summary: This text discusses the market risk disclosures of a company, including their exposure to interest rate fluctuations, foreign currency exchange risk, and their investment activities.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our debt between fixed rate and variable rate obligations. While we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk. As of December 31, 2019, the face value of long-term debt was $8.7 billion, including $5.8 billion of variable rate obligations.\nWe have entered into ten interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on $3.0 billion of variable rate debt, three that became effective on December 31, 2018, four that became effective on January 1, 2019, and three that became effective on January 2, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, $2.8 billion of debt remains subject to variable interest rates for the term of the agreement. See Note 8 for additional information. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as settlements occur. Changes in the variable interest rates to be received pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements will have a corresponding effect on future cash flows.\nWe do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nThe table below provides information as of December 31, 2019 about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates including the cash flows associated with amortization, the notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments, and related weighted average interest rates. Principal amounts are used to calculate the payments to be exchanged under the related agreements and weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of December 31, 2019.\n____________________\n(1)\nThese amounts represent the interest rate swap notional amounts that mature at the end of each respective year. See Note 8 for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term variable rate debt reflects borrowings under our credit facilities provided to us by a consortium of banks of $5.8 billion with $1.1 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. The interest rates charged on borrowings under these facilities are a function of LIBOR. As such, the interest rates charged to us for borrowings under the facilities are subject to change as LIBOR changes. Assuming a constant outstanding balance for our variable rate long-term debt and the effect of our interest rate swaps, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would increase interest expense approximately $28 million while a hypothetical 1% decrease in interest rates would decrease interest expense approximately $28 million.\nThe fair value of the CEC Convertible Notes is subject to interest rate and market price risk due to the conversion features of the notes and other factors. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair value of the notes may also increase as the market price of our stock rises or due to increased volatility in our stock price, and decrease as the market price of our stock falls or due to decreased volatility in our stock price. Interest rate and market value changes affect the fair value of the notes, and may affect the prices at which we would be able to repurchase such notes were we to do so.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "The company has exposure to market risk, primarily from interest rate risk associated with its debt.

The following are our financial instruments which expose us to market risk:\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2019, the face value of long-term debt was $8,843 million, including $4,297 million of variable-rate obligations that fluctuate based on LIBOR (of which, $800 million is effectively fixed pursuant to interest rate swap contracts that mature in February 2022) (see Notes 15 and 16). Assuming a constant outstanding balance for our variable-rate long term debt, a hypothetical 1% change in interest rates would result in interest expense changing by approximately $43 million. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the average one-month LIBOR was 2.19%, 2.18%, and 1.24%, respectively. All of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes. We have attempted to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by using interest rate swap contracts to mitigate interest rate risk associated with a portion of our variable-rate debt instruments. The objective of our interest rate swap contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges of the future interest payments, is to eliminate the variability of cash flows attributable to the LIBOR component of interest expense to be paid on a portion of our variable-rate debt.\nCross-Currency Interest Rate Swaps\nIn connection with the February 2018 Refinancing (see Note 15), we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to achieve more attractive interest rates by effectively converting $460 million of our fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated 2025 Secured Notes, including the semi-annual interest payments through October 2023, to a fixed-rate Euro-denominated debt, with a fixed annual weighted interest rate of approximately 2.946%. We have designated these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in our operating results caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar.\nAs of December 31, 2019, if these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements were ineffective, the fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar would impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we would require to settle the Euro-denominated debt at maturity of these agreements. A hypothetical 10% change in the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the Euro exchange rate upon inception of the cross-currency interest rate swap would have increased/decreased our obligation to cash settle the exchanged principal portion in U.S. Dollars by approximately $46 million.\nNet Investment Non-derivative Hedge - 2026 Secured and Unsecured Euro Notes\nIn February 2018, we designated a portion of our 2026 Secured Euro Notes as a net investment non-derivative hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in our operating results caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar.\nFluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the 2026 Secured Euro Notes and 2026 Unsecured Euro Notes at maturity. A hypothetical 10% change in U.S. Dollar in comparison to the Euro as of December 31, 2019, would have increased/decreased our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the 2026 Secured and Unsecured Euro Notes in U.S. Dollars by approximately $64 million.\nFor additional information regarding interest rate swap contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and net investment non-derivative hedges see Note 16.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk associated with financial instruments such as long-term debt, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and net investment non-derivative hedges. These instruments are exposed to changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. As of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 1% change in interest rates would result in a $43 million change in interest expense, and a hypothetical 10% change in the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the Euro exchange rate would have increased/decreased the obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the 2026 Secured and Unsecured Euro Notes in U.S. Dollars by approximately $64 million."}
{"section": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risks Associated with Financial Instruments\nOur investments and debt are exposed to market risks, discussed below.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment Securities\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of $2.860 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.860 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) money market funds; (c) debt instruments of the United States Government and its agencies; (d) commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and/or (e) instruments with similar risk, duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper and corporate obligations described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, among other things, continue investing in our business, pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions, fund ongoing operations, repay debt obligations and expand our business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio can fluctuate significantly as cash is received and used in our business for these or other purposes. The value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses; however, this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer.\nInterest Rate Risk\nA change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio; however, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Based on our December 31, 2019 current non-strategic investment portfolio of $2.860 billion, a hypothetical 10% change in average interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value due to the limited duration of our investments.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2019 of 2.5%. A change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re-invested at different rates as the instruments mature. A hypothetical 10% decrease in average interest rates during 2019 would result in a decrease of approximately $6 million in annual interest income.\nRestricted Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Investment Securities\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $61 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in: (a) cash; (b) money market funds; (c) debt instruments of the United States Government and its agencies; and/or (d) instruments with similar risk, duration and credit quality characteristics to commercial paper. Based on our December 31, 2019 investment portfolio, a hypothetical 10% increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities.\nLong-Term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had long-term debt of $14.671 billion, excluding finance lease obligations and unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discounts, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We estimated the fair value of this debt to be approximately $14.968 billion using quoted market prices. The fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $249 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our future costs of financing would increase at the time of any future financings. As of December 31, 2019, all of our long-term debt consisted of fixed rate indebtedness.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nFrom time to time, we invest in speculative financial instruments, including derivatives. As of December 31, 2019, we did not hold any derivative financial instruments.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary:\nOur investments and debt are exposed to market risks, including cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities, interest rate risk, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities, and long-term debt.

Revenue for 2019 was $343.0 million, a decrease of 22.5% from 2018 revenue of $442.6 million. Systems revenue for 2019 was $202.6 million, compared to $280.4 million in 2018. Operating profit was $24.2 million in 2019, compared to $60.0 million in 2018. Net income for the year was $17.0 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.50. This compares to 2018 net income of $45.9 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.35.\nDespite lower year over year financial results, other metrics show Axcelis\u2019 continuing improvement. 2019 marked the first time Axcelis has remained profitable through a full industry cycle. We have now achieved over 5 years of consecutive quarterly profits while making investments that put the Company in a stronger competitive position as we enter what should be a period of extended growth. A focused strategy on ion implant, combined with the hard work and dedication of our employees and the encouragement and support of our customers and suppliers, enabled us to achieve numerous critical milestones in our drive to market leadership. In 2019, we continued to expand the Purion installed base, growing our large and diverse group of customers. We also sharpened our focus on key market segments in the mature process technology areas, such as image sensors and power devices. We grew our family of Purion product extensions with the launch of four new Purion implanters specifically targeted at these segments. Through the introduction of new Purion product extensions and continuous cost out activity, we improved our gross margin year over year, making this the second consecutive year with gross margin greater than 40 percent. Additionally, we maintained a strong balance sheet free of debt and instituted a share repurchase program.\nWe continue to work diligently to ensure that manufacturing and operating expense levels remain well aligned to business conditions.

Our primary business is to provide asset management and certain corporate governance services to institutional investors. In October 2013, we applied for and were granted registration by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) as a registered investment adviser under Section 203(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. We operate in a single segment focused on providing asset management and certain corporate governance services to investment vehicles.\nOur primary client is Front Yard Residential Corporation (\u201cFront Yard\u201d), a public real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) focused on acquiring and managing quality, affordable single-family rental (\u201cSFR\u201d) properties for America's families.

Our potential new businesses are in the development stage under the leadership and direction of our new Co-Chief Executive Officer and may include asset management services, investments in real estate related assets or other businesses that leverage the experience of our new Co-Chief Executive Officer and our real estate asset acquisition and portfolio management teams. Our incumbent Co-Chief Executive Officer has continued to focus on the business of Front Yard and the completion of its strategic alternatives review.\nOn February 17, 2020, Front Yard's strategic alternatives review was completed, culminating in Front Yard's entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with affiliates of Amherst Single Family Residential Partners VI, LP (\u201cAmherst\u201d), providing for the acquisition of Front Yard by Amherst (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The Merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to the approval of the holders of a majority of Front Yard\u2019s outstanding shares and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. If notice of termination of the Amended AMA is given upon the consummation of the Merger, a termination fee of approximately $46.3 million would become payable to us upon the effective date of such termination. Such termination fee would be payable, at Front Yard's option, in either (i) a lump sum on the effective date of the termination or (ii) one half on the effective date of the termination with the remainder due in equal installments on each of the six-, nine- and twelve-month anniversaries thereafter. We would also continue to receive management fees under the Amended AMA through the 180-day notice period of termination.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nImportant considerations in asset/liability management are liquidity, the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the adequacy of capital. Interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are those which have yields on rates subject to change within a future time period due to maturity of the instrument or changes in market rates. While liquidity management involves meeting the funds flow requirements of the Company, the management of interest rate sensitivity focuses on the structure of these assets and liabilities with respect to maturity and repricing characteristics. Balancing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities provides a means of tempering fluctuating interest rates and maintaining net interest margins through periods of changing interest rates. The Company monitors interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to determine the overall interest rate position over various time frames.\nThe Company considers the primary market exposure to be interest rate risk. Simulation analysis is used to monitor the Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates, and the effect of the change to net interest income. The following table shows the effect on net interest income and the net present value of equity in the event of a sudden and sustained 300 basis point increase and 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates. The assumptions and predictions include inputs to compute baseline net interest income, growth rates, expected changes in rates on interest bearing deposit accounts and loans, competition and various other factors that are difficult to accurately predict.\nIt should be noted that at December 31, 2019 and 2018, the change in the net present value of equity exceeded policy when the simulation model assumed a sudden decrease in rates of 100 basis points (1%). This is primarily due to the positive impact on the fair value of assets not being as great as the negative impact on the fair value of certain liabilities. Specifically, because core deposits typically bear relatively low interest rates, their fair value would be negatively impacted as the rates could not be adjusted by the full extent of the sudden decrease in rates. Management will continue to monitor the policy exception and may consider changes to the asset/liability position in the future. The remaining results of the simulations indicate that interest rate change results fall within internal limits established by the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018. A report on interest rate risk is presented to the Board of Directors and the Asset/Liability Committee on a quarterly basis. The Company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes, nor does it hold derivative financial instruments, and does not plan to purchase these instruments in the near future.\nWith the largest amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities maturing within twelve months, the Company monitors this area most closely. Early withdrawal of deposits, prepayments of loans and loan delinquencies are some of the factors that can impact actual results in comparison to our simulation analysis. In addition, changes in rates on interest sensitive assets and liabilities may not be equal, which could result in a change in net interest margin.\nInterest rate sensitivity management provides some degree of protection against net interest income volatility. It is not possible or necessarily desirable to attempt to eliminate this risk completely by matching interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Other factors, such as market demand, interest rate outlook, regulatory restraint and strategic planning also have an effect on the desired balance sheet structure.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nIn general, business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices, and that can affect the cost of operating, investing and financing under those conditions. The Company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks. The Company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on hypothetical changes in rates and prices.\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt. As such, the Company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs. At December 31, 2019, approximately $377 million of the Company\u2019s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps. The remainder of the debt (approximately $5.3 billion) carries a fixed rate of interest. Based upon the Company\u2019s debt structure at December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 1% increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately $3.8 million and decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $323 million.\nWhile the Company transacts business predominantly in U.S. dollars and most of its revenues are collected in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s operating costs are denominated in other currencies, such as the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian dollar, European Euro, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso. Changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect Company\u2019s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses. For 2019, approximately 33% of the Company\u2019s sales were denominated in foreign currencies, the most significant of which were: European Euro, approximately 10%; and Canadian dollar, approximately 4%. The primary purpose of the Company\u2019s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.\nThe Company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials. As such, the Company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the Company enters into commodity-based derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the Company\u2019s raw materials. A hypothetical 10% change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the Company\u2019s results of operations. In this sensitivity analysis, all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency\u2019s rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not impact another currency\u2019s rates relative to the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments, all of which are highly rated institutions; however, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by such counterparties.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices.

Market risk occurs in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads.\nOverview\nInterest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (repricing risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers\u2019 ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors\u2019 ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR (basis risk).\nThe Company\u2019s Board ALCO establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. Board ALCO establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the Board of Directors\u2019 policies. In general, The Company seeks to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities. Board ALCO meets quarterly to monitor the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the Board of Directors\u2019 approved risk limits. As discussed earlier, the Company also has a Management ALCO, which is comprised of senior management team and Chief Executive Officer, to proactively monitor interest rate risk.\nInterest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints.\nAn asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on interest-earning assets, thus compressing net interest margin.\nMeasurement\nInterest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the Board ALCO at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk. In order to better-position balance sheet to\nmatch the current and potential future interest rate environment, the Company had increased the proportion of fixed rate loans\nthroughout 2019.\nThe Company uses two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk (\u201cNII at Risk\u201d), and Economic Value of Equity (\u201cEVE\u201d). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivatives. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement.\nThe following table presents the projected changes in NII at Risk and EVE that would occur upon an immediate change in interest rates based on independent analysis, but without giving effect to any steps that management might take to counteract that change as of the dates indicated:\nItem 8", "summary": "A Summary: The Company's Board ALCO establishes policy limits with respect to interest rate risk and meets quarterly to monitor the level of risk sensitivity.

{"section": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn June 17, 1997, PECO Energy Company-Power Team (\"PECO\") filed an application with FERC pursuant to Section 211 of the Federal Power Act requesting FERC to compel Oglethorpe and/or GTC to provide PECO with 250 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from the TVA-Integrated Transmission System (\"TVA-ITS\") interface to the Florida-Integrated Transmission System interface for an initial three-year period, with an automatic roll-over provision. PECO also seeks $10,000 per day in penalties from Oglethorpe and/or GTC, alleging bad faith and delays in negotiations. In their response to FERC, GTC and Oglethorpe contend that they negotiated with PECO in good faith, and thus there is no reasonable basis for imposing the penalties sought by PECO. GTC also responded that it does not have firm \"available transfer capability\" at the TVA-ITS interface to fulfill PECO's request, after taking into account the need to protect system reliability, existing firm commitments, and use of the TVA-ITS interface to serve \"native load,\" in accordance with North American Electric Reliability Council guidelines. Since this action involves transmission access to the ITS and is exclusively a transmission matter, Oglethorpe has requested that FERC dismiss the action as to Oglethorpe. In the event GTC is ordered by FERC to provide the requested service, PECO would be required to compensate GTC at rates set by FERC in the order. As a consequence of any such order, power purchased by Oglethorpe for delivery through the TVA-ITS interface would probably be curtailed (based on past operational experience at that interface), and could result in higher purchased power cost than would otherwise be the case. Although FERC transmission pricing policy is designed to ensure that a transmission provider is fully compensated for the cost of providing transmission service, potentially including opportunity cost, there can be no assurance that rates ordered by FERC for service to PECO would fully compensate GTC, Oglethorpe and the Members for the use of the transmission system and for any resulting effect on reliability or increase in the cost of power.\nAs previously reported, Oglethorpe and LEM have been addressing a number of issues relating to administration of the power marketer agreement entered into in 1997. In February 2001, LEM initiated the contractually defined arbitration process to resolve these issues. Oglethorpe continues to receive power under the LEM agreement. Oglethorpe's management does not expect the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. For a discussion of the LEM agreement, see \"OGLETHORPE'S POWER SUPPLY RESOURCES--Power Marketer Arrangements--LEM Agreement\" in Item 1.\nOglethorpe is a party to various other actions and proceedings incidental to its normal business. Liability in the event of final adverse determinations in any of these matters is either covered by insurance or, in the opinion of Oglethorpe's management, after consultation with counsel, should not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of Oglethorpe.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nPECO Energy Company-Power Team has filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to compel Oglethorpe Power Corporation and/or Georgia Transmission Corporation (GTC) to provide PECO with 250 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service. Oglethorpe and GTC have responded that they negotiated with PECO in good faith and that GTC does not have the necessary firm available transfer capability.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nYou are cautioned that statements contained in this section are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the disclosure under the heading \u201cCautionary Statement\u201d and the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d set forth above.\nWe are exposed to market risks associated with changes in interest rates as they relate to our mortgage loans receivable and debt. Interest rate risk is sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe do not utilize interest rate swaps, forward or option contracts, or foreign currencies or commodities, or other types of derivative financial instruments nor do we engage in \u201coff-balance sheet\u201d transactions. The purpose of the following disclosure is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2019.\nOur future earnings, cash flows and estimated fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, such as LIBOR or term rates of U.S. Treasury Notes. Changes in interest rates generally impact the fair value, but not future earnings or cash flows, of mortgage loans receivable and fixed rate debt. Our mortgage loans receivable and debt, such as our senior unsecured notes, are primarily fixed-rate instruments. For variable rate debt, such as our revolving line of credit, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value, but do affect future earnings and cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2019, the fair value of our mortgage loans receivable using a 9.0% discount rate was approximately $312.8 million. A 1% increase in such rate would decrease the estimated fair value of our mortgage loans by approximately $27.0 million while a 1% decrease in such rate would increase their estimated fair value by approximately $31.5 million. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of our senior unsecured notes using a 3.70% discount rate for those maturing before year 2026 and 3.90% discount rate for those maturing at or beyond year 2026 was approximately $612.4 million. A 1% increase in such rate would decrease the estimated fair value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately $31.7 million while a 1% decrease in such rate would increase their estimated fair\nvalue by approximately $34.2 million. These discount rates were measured based upon management\u2019s estimates of rates currently prevailing for comparable loans available to us and instruments of comparable maturities.\nThe estimated impact of changes in interest rates discussed above are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs, lending rates and current U.S. Treasury rates from which our financial instruments may be priced. We do not believe that future market rate risks related to our financial instruments will be material to our financial position or results of operations. These analyses do not consider the effects of industry specific events, changes in the real estate markets, or other overall economic activities that could increase or decrease the fair value of our financial instruments. If such events or changes were to occur, we would consider taking actions to mitigate and/or reduce any negative exposure to such changes. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThis section of the text discusses the market risks associated with changes in interest rates and their impact on the fair value of the company's mortgage loans receivable and debt.

If a material loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. With respect to currently pending legal proceedings, we have not established an estimated range of reasonably possible material losses either because we believe that we have valid defenses to claims asserted against us, the proceeding has not advanced to a stage of discovery that would enable us to establish an estimate, or the potential loss is not material. We currently do not expect the outcome of pending legal proceedings to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Litigation, however, is inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that the ultimate outcome of one or more claims asserted against us could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

{"section": "Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe primary market risks to which the Company is exposed include changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. The Company manages these risks through derivative instruments and various operating actions including fixed price contracts with suppliers and cost sourcing arrangements with customers. The Company's use of derivative instruments is limited to mitigation of market risks, including hedging activities. However, derivative instruments are not used for speculative or trading purposes, as per clearly defined risk management policies. Additionally, the Company's use of derivative instruments creates exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counter-party to the derivative financial instruments. The Company limits this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a variety of major financial institutions with high credit standards and that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. Additionally, the Company's ability to utilize derivatives to manage market risk is dependent on credit conditions and market conditions given the current economic environment.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Company\u2019s net cash inflows and outflows exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates arise from the sale of products in countries other than the manufacturing source, foreign currency denominated supplier payments, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, investments in subsidiaries and anticipated foreign currency denominated transaction proceeds. Where possible, the Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks. Forward and option contracts may be utilized to reduce the impact to the Company's cash flow from adverse movements in exchange rates. Foreign currency exposures are reviewed periodically and any natural offsets are considered prior to entering into a derivative financial instrument. The Company\u2019s current primary hedged foreign currency exposures include the Japanese Yen, Euro and Mexican Peso. Where possible, the Company utilizes a strategy of partial coverage for transactions in these currencies. The Company's policy requires that hedge transactions relate to a specific portion of the exposure not to exceed the aggregate amount of the underlying transaction.\nIn addition to the transactional exposure described above, the Company's operating results are impacted by the translation of its foreign operating income into U.S. dollars. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate this exposure.\nThe hypothetical pretax gain or loss in fair value from a 10% favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately $32 million for foreign currency derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. These estimated changes assume a parallel shift in all currency exchange rates and include the gain or loss on financial instruments used to hedge investments in subsidiaries. Because exchange rates typically do not all move in the same direction, the estimate may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on the net fair value of the Company's financial derivatives. It is also important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged.\nInterest Rate Risk\nSee Note 19, \"Financial Instruments\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8", "summary": "of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's exposure to interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe company\u2019s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts may be used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risks\nThe company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the Brazilian Real, European Euro (\"EUR\"), Canadian dollar and Indian rupee. The company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar (\"USD\") amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency.\nThe following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates.\nSince the company's risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.\nAs part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service Corteva and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.\nThe company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global product lines.\nThe company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by region.\nPart II\nITEM 8.", "summary": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nCorteva Inc. is exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFOREIGN CURRENCIES\nSCM Microsystems transacts business in various foreign currencies, primarily in certain European countries, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to yen denominated sales in Japan and local currency denominated operating expenses in the UK, Europe and Singapore, where we sell in both local currencies and U.S. dollars. We currently do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency activity at any of our foreign locations. Instead, we believe that a natural hedge exists, in that local currency revenues substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposure on an ongoing basis.\nSCM's foreign currency transactions gains or losses are primarily the result of the revaluation of intercompany receivables/payables (denominated in U.S. dollars) and trade receivables (denominated in a currency other than the functional currency) to the functional currency of the subsidiary.\nA 10% adverse change in the U.S. dollar compared to the Company's other functional currency would have had an effect of $1.1 million on its 2000 net income.\nFIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS\nSCM's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. We place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy.

We have not entered, nor do we intend to enter, into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes.\nHypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates chosen for the following estimated sensitivity analysis are considered to be reasonable near-term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category. However, since it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates, these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe operate in a number of foreign locations, which gives rise to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To the extent possible, we attempt to denominate our transactions in foreign locations in U.S. dollars. For those cases in which transactions are not denominated in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to risk from changes in exchange rates to the extent that non-U.S. dollar revenues exceed non-U.S. dollar expenses related to those operations. Our non-U.S. dollar transactions are denominated primarily in Canadian and British pound sterling. As a result of these transactions, we generally hold cash balances that are denominated in these foreign currencies. At January 31, 2020, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents included foreign currency denominated amounts equivalent to approximately $673,000 in U.S. dollars. A 10% increase in the U.S. dollar as compared to each of these currencies would result in a loss of approximately $67,300 in the U.S. dollar value of these deposits, while a 10% decrease would result in an equal amount of gain. We do not currently hold or issue foreign exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge these exposures.\nSome of our foreign operations have been conducted through wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe may periodically enter into certain interest rate protection and interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert existing floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We currently have interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rates on outstanding debt with notional amounts totaling $390.0 million. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to our outstanding derivatives.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 1% of our outstanding consolidated debt, excluding the amount of variable rate debt with interest rate protection agreements in place, had variable interest rates and therefore was subject to market fluctuations. A change in the LIBOR index of 100 basis points would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $114,000 in interest expense on an annual basis.\nThe interest rate spreads associated with our unsecured lines of credit and our unsecured term loan are based on the higher of our two investment grade credit ratings. Changes to our credit ratings could cause our interest rate spread to adjust accordingly. In February 2020, due to a change in our credit rating, our interest rate spread over LIBOR on our $600.0 million unsecured line of credit facility increased from 0.875% to 1.0% and our annual facility fee increased from 0.15% to 0.20%. As of December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding balances under our unsecured lines of credit. In addition, our interest rate spread over LIBOR on our $350.0 million unsecured term loan increased from 0.90% to 1.0%. If additional decreases to our credit ratings occurs, interest expense could increase depending upon the level of downgrade.\nThe information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value. As a result, the ultimate effect upon our operating results of interest rate fluctuations will depend on the interest rate exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time and future changes in the level of interest rates.\nThe estimated fair value and recorded value of our debt consisting of senior unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, secured mortgages and unsecured lines of credit was as follows (in thousands):\nA 100 basis point increase from prevailing interest rates at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 would result in a decrease in fair value of total consolidated debt of approximately $62.9 million and $65.6 million, respectively.

Our currency exposure is concentrated in the Canadian Dollar. To mitigate the risk related to changes in foreign currency, cash flows received from our Canadian joint ventures are either reinvested to fund ongoing Canadian development activities, if applicable, or converted to U.S. dollars and utilized to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket Risks\nMarket risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets will affect the spread between our floating rate assets and liabilities subject to the net amount of floating rate assets/liabilities and the impact of interest rate floors and caps. Any significant compression of the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn the event of a significant rising interest rate environment or economic downturn, defaults could increase and cause us to incur additional credit losses which would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. Such delinquencies or defaults would likely have a material adverse effect on the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, an increase in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the value of our fixed-rate interest-bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. We monitor the spreads between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and may implement hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations, including engaging in interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and other interest rate-related derivative contracts. Such strategies are designed to reduce our exposure, on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in our credit risk or the credit risk of our borrowers.\nWhile a REIT may utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets without generating non-qualifying income, use of derivatives for other purposes will generate non-qualified income for REIT income test purposes. This includes hedging asset related risks such as credit, foreign exchange and interest rate exposure on our loan assets. As a result our ability to hedge these types of risks is limited. There can be no assurance that our profitability will not be materially adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates.\nThe following table quantifies the potential changes in annual net income, assuming no change in our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, should interest rates increase or decrease by 10, 50 or 100 basis points, assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve (i.e., relative interest rates). The base interest rate scenario assumes the one-month LIBOR rate of 1.76% as of December 31, 2019. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.\nEstimated Change In Net Income\n($ in thousands)\n______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nWe have an overall net variable-rate asset position, which results in an increase in net income when rates increase and a decrease in net income when rates decrease. As of December 31, 2019, $400.4 million of our floating rate loans have a cumulative weighted average LIBOR floor of 1.3% and $35.7 million of our floating rate debt has a cumulative weighted average interest rate floor of 0.4%.\nItem 8.", "summary": "Summary:\nThis text discusses the market risk to which the company is exposed, primarily interest rate risk.

{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company has exposure to changing interest rates primarily under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, each of which bears interest at variable rates based on LIBOR. The Company had $2,874 million of variable rate loans outstanding as of September 30, 2019.\nOn May 16, 2018, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties, which fixed a portion of the variable interest due under its Term Loan Credit Agreement (the \"Swap Agreements\"). Under the terms of the Swap Agreements, which mature on December 15, 2022, the Company pays a fixed rate of 2.935% and receives a variable rate of interest based on one-month LIBOR. As of September 30, 2019, the total notional amount of the six Swap Agreements was $1,800 million.\nIt is management\u2019s intention that the notional amount of the Swap Agreements be less than the variable rate loans outstanding during the life of the derivatives. For fiscal 2019 and the period from December 16, 2017 through September 30, 2018, the Company recognized a loss on its hedge contracts of $10 million and $6 million, respectively, which is reflected in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At September 30, 2019, the fair value of the outstanding Swap Agreements was a deferred loss of $80 million. Based on the payment dates of the contracts, $23 million and $58 million, including accrued interest, was recorded in Other current liabilities and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. On an annual basis, a hypothetical one percent change in interest rates for the $1,074 million of unhedged variable rate debt as of September 30, 2019 would affect interest expense by approximately $11 million.\nForeign Currency Risk\nForeign currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of our non-U.S. (\"foreign\") operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are Euros, Canadian Dollars, British Pound Sterling, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Australian Dollars, Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen.\nNon-U.S. denominated revenue was $636 million for fiscal 2019. We estimate a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all foreign currencies would affect our revenue for fiscal 2019 by $64 million.\nThe Company, from time-to-time, utilizes foreign currency forward contracts primarily to hedge fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities including receivables, payables and certain intercompany obligations. These foreign currency forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net to offset the change in the value of the underlying assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2019, the Company maintained open foreign exchange contracts with a total notional value of $400 million, primarily hedging the British Pound Sterling, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Koruna, Mexican Peso and Australian Dollar. At September 30, 2019, the fair value of the open foreign exchange contracts was $1 million and recorded in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2019, the Company's loss on foreign exchange contracts was $5 million and was recorded within Other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company did not maintain any foreign currency forward contracts as of September 30, 2018.\nItem 8.", "summary": "The Company has exposure to changing interest rates primarily under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, each of which bears interest at variable rates based on LIBOR.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. A discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below.\nBaker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10-K | 43\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nAll of our long-term debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments. We are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio. We may use interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt. There were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.\n(1)\nFair market value of our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019.\n(2)\nAmounts represent the principal value of our long-term debt outstanding and related weighted average interest rates at the end of the respective period.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK\nWe conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies, and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency. As such, future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies.\nAdditionally, we buy, manufacture and sell components and products across global markets. These activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses. When the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates, it will affect the revenue earned on the sale. These sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates. Changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing. We use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures, where appropriate.\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts. We had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with net notional amounts aggregating $1.8 billion and $2.8 billion to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates that a 1% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar would result in an impact of less than $5 million to our pre-tax earnings, however, the Company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure, where there are liquid financial markets, through use of foreign currency derivative transactions. Also, see \"Note 17. Financial Instruments\" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8", "summary": "of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nBaker Hughes Company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

{"section": "Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Our primary market risks include interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nInterest Rate Risk. We have both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, and are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable-rate debt. Our interest expense, net was $569.0 million for 2019, treating our former Epsilon segment as a discontinued operation. To manage our risk from market interest rates, we actively monitor interest rates and other interest sensitive components to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets, net income and cash flow. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates through the use of fixed-rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements. In addition, we may enter into derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on related financial instruments or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes.\nThe approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis, which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business. This approach calculates the impact on pre-tax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in interest rates of 1%. In 2019, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates on our variable-rate debt would have resulted in a change to our interest expense of approximately $83 million. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the appropriateness of the related assumptions.\nCredit Risk. We are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients\u2019 customers. Our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label or co-brand credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances. To minimize our risk of credit card loan charge-offs, we have developed automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to make risk-based origination decisions when approving new accountholders, establishing or adjusting their credit limits and applying our risk-based pricing. We also utilize a proprietary collection scoring algorithm to assess accounts for collections efforts if they become delinquent; after exhausting all in-house collection efforts, we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. and the Canadian dollar and between the U.S. dollar and the Euro. For the year ended December 31, 2019, an additional 10% decrease in the strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar and the Euro versus the U.S. dollar would have resulted in an additional decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $13 million and $3 million, respectively. Conversely, a corresponding increase in the strength of the Canadian dollar or the Euro versus the U.S. dollar would result in a comparable increase to pre-tax income in these periods.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A Summary: Synchrony Financial is exposed to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign currency exchange rate risk.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nTEP\u2019s financial statements are exposed to certain market risks that can affect asset and liability fair value, results of operations, and cash flows. TEP's significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates, commodity and coal prices, and extension of credit to counterparties. TEP may enter into interest rate swaps and financing transactions to manage changes in interest rates. TEP has a RMC responsible for the oversight of commodity price risk and credit risk related to wholesale energy marketing and power procurement activities. To limit TEP\u2019s exposure to commodity price risk, the RMC sets trading and hedging policies and limits, which are reviewed frequently to respond to constantly changing market conditions. To limit TEP\u2019s exposure to credit risk, the RMC reviews counterparty credit exposure as well as credit policies and limits on a regular basis.\nInterest Rate Risk\nCredit Agreements\nTEP is subject to interest rate risk resulting from changes in interest rates on borrowings under its credit agreements. The interest rate paid on borrowings is variable. Amounts borrowed under the credit agreements are made on either the basis of a spread over LIBOR or an ABR. As a result, TEP may experience significant volatility in the rates paid on LIBOR borrowings under its credit agreements.\nThe 2019 Credit Agreement is a 364-day credit agreement that provides for up to $225 million in term loans, which could be drawn in up to two drawings. As of December 31, 2019, TEP had borrowed $165 million under the 2019 Credit Agreement. As of February 12, 2020, TEP had borrowed $225 million under the 2019 Credit Agreement.\nThe 2015 Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature in October 2022 and provides for up to $250 million in credit borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, TEP had no revolving credit borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement. In January 2020, TEP delivered $12 million in LOCs pursuant to TEP taking ownership of Oso Grande under the build-transfer agreement. As of February 12, 2020, there was $173 million available under the 2015 Credit Agreement.\nCommodity and Coal Price Risk\nTEP is exposed to market fluctuations in electricity, natural gas, and coal prices as a result of its obligation to serve retail customer load in its regulated service territory and long-term wholesale contracts. TEP's load and generation facilities represent substantial underlying commodity positions. Exposure to commodity prices consist primarily of variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity that is purchased and sold in retail and wholesale markets. Commodity and coal prices may be subject to significant price changes as supply and demand are impacted by, among other unpredictable factors, weather, market liquidity, generation facility availability, customer usage, storage, and transmission and transportation constraints. Under the guidance of the Risk Management Committee (RMC), TEP mitigates a portion of its commodity price risk through the use of commodity contracts, which include forwards, financial swaps, and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply, fix fluctuating commodity prices, or sell future production generally at fixed prices. TEP's exposure to commodity and coal price risk is limited by its ability to include these costs in regulated rates through its PPFAC mechanism, which is subject to review annually by the ACC.

{"section": "Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt, including its revolving credit facility and term loan facility. Assuming no changes in the Company\u2019s capital structure, if market interest rates average 1% more over the next 12 months than the interest rates as of December 31, 2020, interest expense for the next 12 months would increase by approximately $1.2 million. This amount was determined by calculating the effect of the hypothetical interest rate on the unhedged portion of the Company\u2019s variable rate debt. This calculated, hypothetical increase in interest expense for the following 12 months may be different from the actual increase in interest expense from a 1% increase in interest rates due to varying interest rate reset dates on the Company\u2019s variable rate debt.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition related contingent consideration, which is adjusted to fair value each reporting period, is also impacted by changes in interest rates. The risk-free interest rate used to estimate the Company\u2019s WACC is a component of the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future cash flows due under the CBA. As a result, any changes in the underlying risk-free interest rate could result in material changes to the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of non-cash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.\nThe Company is exposed to certain market risks and commodity price risk that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company is also subject to commodity price risk arising from price movements for certain commodities included as part of its raw materials. The Company manages this commodity price risk in some cases by entering into contracts with adjustable prices to hedge commodity purchases. The Company periodically uses commodity derivative instruments in the management of this risk. The Company estimates a 10% increase in the market prices of commodities included as part of its raw materials over the current market prices would cumulatively increase costs during the next 12 months by approximately $58.4 million assuming no change in volume.\nFees paid by the Company for agreements to hedge commodity purchases are amortized over the corresponding period of the agreement. The Company accounts for its commodity derivative instruments on a mark-to-market basis with any expense or income being reflected as an adjustment to cost of sales or SD&A expenses, consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item.\nThe annual rate of inflation in the United States, as measured by year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index (the \u201cCPI\u201d), was 1.4% in 2020, 2.3% in 2019 and 2.4% in 2018. Inflation in the prices of those commodities important to the Company\u2019s business is reflected in changes in the CPI, but commodity prices are volatile and in recent years have moved at a faster rate of change than the CPI.\nThe principal effect of inflation in both commodity and consumer prices on the Company\u2019s operating results is to increase costs, both of goods sold and SD&A expenses. Although the Company can offset these cost increases by increasing selling prices for its products, consumers may not have the buying power to cover these increased costs and may reduce their volume of purchases of those products. In that event, selling price increases may not be sufficient to offset completely the Company\u2019s cost increases.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk summarizes the Company's exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, commodity price risk, and inflation.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs while taking into account variable interest rate risk. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed or variable rates.\nWe have entered into and may continue to enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not apply hedge accounting treatment to these derivatives, therefore changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative financial instruments are recorded as a component of interest expense in gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

{"section": "Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, but we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long-term fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible.\nThe following disclosures of estimated fair value of financial instruments are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of important assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows, risks, discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument. Readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in these paragraphs are forward-looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading \u201cForward-looking Statements and Factors Affecting Future Results\u201d set forth above. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange.\nMortgage notes receivable - The fair value of mortgage notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.\nDirect financing leases - The fair value of the investments in direct financing leases are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates being offered for similar leases to borrowers with similar credit ratings. In addition, we may estimate the fair value of its investment based on the estimated fair value of the collateral using a market approach which reflects of the expected proceeds from the buyer based on the terms of the sale agreement.\nOther investments - The fair value of other investments is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.\nBorrowings under our credit agreements and term loan - The fair value of our borrowings under our credit agreements and term loan is estimated using an expected present value technique based on expected cash flows discounted using the current credit-adjusted risk-free rate.\nSenior unsecured notes and HUD mortgages -The fair value of the senior unsecured notes and HUD mortgages is estimated based on open market trading activity provided by third parties.\nThe market value of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages is subject to interest rate risks. Generally, the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall. The estimated fair value of our total long-term borrowings at December 31, 2019 was approximately $5.5 billion. A one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long-term borrowings by approximately $296.2 million at December 31, 2019.\nWe may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk. We use interest rate swap agreements, for example, to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixed-rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. At December 31, 2019, $3.7 million of qualifying cash flow hedges were recorded at fair value in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2018, $4.0 million of qualifying cash flow hedges were recorded at fair value in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nItem 8", "summary": "A provides a summary of the market risks associated with the company's long-term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages.

The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates. The range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $51.4 million of unhedged borrowings outstanding under the Revolver (before the netting of unamortized deferred financing costs) that bears interest at a variable rate.

At December 31, 2019, LIBOR on our outstanding floating-rate borrowings was 1.84%. Assuming no increase in the amount of our variable interest rate debt, if LIBOR increased 100 basis points, our cash flow would decrease by approximately $0.5 million annually.

Assuming no increase in the amount of our variable rate debt, if LIBOR were reduced 100 basis points, our cash flow would increase by approximately $1.1 million annually.\nOur interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. As of October 3, 2019, in total we had entered into five interest rate swaps with three counterparties to hedge the LIBOR component of our interest rate risk related to the Term Loan. Together, these swaps fix the LIBOR component of the entire $300 million Term Loan on a weighted average basis at 2.17%. See Note 4 - \u201cCredit Facility, Notes Payable and Derivative Instruments\u201d for further detail on our interest rate swaps. We may enter into additional derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and caps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on our future borrowings. We will not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.\nIn addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our investments is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants/operators and borrowers, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "A. provides a summary of the market risk to which the company is exposed, primarily interest rate risk.

{"section": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe chief market risk factor affecting the financial condition and operating results of the Company is interest rate risk. This risk is managed by periodic evaluation of the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts, determination of the level of risk considered appropriate given capital and liquidity requirements, business strategy, performance objectives and operating environment and maintenance of such risks within guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Through such management, the Company seek to reduce the vulnerability of net earnings to changes in interest rates. The Banks' Asset/Liability Committees, comprised of senior management, are responsible for managing interest rate risk and reviewing with their Boards of Directors on a quarterly basis their activities and strategies, the effect of those strategies on operating results, the Banks' interest rate risk positions and the effect changes in interest rates would have on net interest income. The extent of movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on earnings.\nThe principal strategies that the Company uses to manage interest rate risk include (i) emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate loans, origination of indirect auto loans (Compass only) which have relatively short maturities and origination of loans with maturities at least partially matched with those of the deposits and borrowings funding the loans, (ii) investing in debt securities with relatively short maturities and (iii) classifying a significant portion of the investment portfolio as available for sale so as to provide sufficient flexibility in liquidity management.\nThe Company and the Banks quantify their interest rate risk exposure using a sophisticated simulation model. Simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon. Simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense under various rate scenarios. Internal guidelines on interest rate risk specify that for every 100 basis points immediate shift in interest rates, estimated net interest income over the next twelve months should decline by less than 5%.\nIn utilizing a 300 basis point increase in rates in its simulation model, the full impact of annual rate caps of 200 basis points common to most adjustable rate mortgage loan products is considered. The rate shocks used assume an instantaneous and parallel change in interest rates and that no strategies are implemented in respone to the change in rates. Prepayment speeds for loans are based on published median dealer forecasts for each interest rate scenario.\nAs of December 31, 2000, the Company's estimated exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next twelve and twenty-four month periods is as follows:\nBased on the scenario above, net income would be adversely affected (within internal guidelines) in both the twelve and twenty-four month periods. For each one percentage point change in net interest income, the effect on net income would be $659,000, assuming a 36% tax rate.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text discusses the market risk factors that affect the financial condition and operating results of the Company.

A one percentage point change in net interest income would have an adverse effect on net income of $659,000."}
{"section": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe currently have subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Germany and France. Approximately 26% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were derived from customers with billing addresses outside of the United States and our foreign exchange gains/losses were not significant. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposures are the euro and British pound. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our operating income, based on our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we estimate that a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have decreased operating income by less than $100 thousand assuming that all currencies moved in the same direction at the same time and a constant ratio of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expenses to U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expenses. Since a portion of our revenue is deferred revenue that is recorded at different foreign currency exchange rates, the impact to revenue of a change in foreign currency exchange rates is recognized over time, and the impact to expenses is more immediate, as expenses are recognized at the current foreign currency exchange rate in effect at the time the expense is incurred. We currently believe our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is financially immaterial and therefore have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions.\nWe continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency futures or options in the future. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $57.5 million. The cash, cash equivalents and investments were held for working capital purposes. Approximately 10% of fund were invested in a short-term bond fund. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce future investment income.\nOur exposure to market risk also relates to interest expense on borrowings under the Loan Agreement. The borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at an annual rate of 1.375% plus the higher of the one (1) month U.S. LIBOR rate reported in the Wall Street Journal or two percent (2.00%) (see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Based on the $23.8 million of aggregate principal outstanding under the Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2019, a 200 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense under the Loan Agreement by approximately $0.5 million.\nItem 8.", "summary": "This text is about market risk and the potential losses that may occur due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe following information, together with information included in other parts of this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, describes key aspects of our market risk.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk to us generally represents the risk of changes in the value of our ETPs that results from fluctuations in securities or commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, and interest rates. Nearly all our revenues are derived from advisory agreements for the WisdomTree ETPs. Under these agreements, the advisory fee we receive is based on the average market value of the assets in the WisdomTree ETP portfolios we manage.\nFluctuations in the value of the ETPs are common and are generated by numerous factors such as market volatility, the overall economy, inflation, changes in investor strategies and sentiment, availability of alternative investment vehicles, government regulations and others. Accordingly, changes in any one or a combination of these factors may reduce the value of investment securities and, in turn, the underlying AUM on which our revenues are earned. These declines may cause investors to withdraw funds from our ETPs in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk, thereby compounding the impact on our revenues. We believe challenging and volatile market conditions will continue to be present in the foreseeable future.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe invest our corporate cash in short-term interest earning assets, primarily money market instruments at a commercial bank, federal agency debt instruments and other securities which totaled $27.4 million and $33.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will have a material impact on our financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nIn addition, in connection with the ETFS Acquisition, we obtained a $250.0 million Credit Facility. Interest rate risk is not significant as borrowings under these facilities accrue interest at variable rates (See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\nExchange Rate Risk\nOver the last few years, we have expanded our business globally and are subject to currency translation exposure on the results of our non-U.S.\noperations, primarily in Europe. Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities\u2019 statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to our reporting currency (the U.S. dollar) for consolidation purposes. The advisory fees earned on our International listed ETPs are predominantly in U.S. dollars (and also paid in gold ounces, as described below), however, expenses for corporate overhead are generally incurred in British pounds. Currently, we do not enter into derivative financial instruments aimed at offsetting certain exposures in the statement of operations or the balance sheet but may seek to do so in the future.\nExchange rate risk associated with the Euro and Canadian dollar is not considered to be significant.\nCommodity Price Risk\nFluctuations in the prices of commodities that are linked to certain of our ETPs could have a material adverse effect on our AUM and revenues. In addition, a portion of the advisory fee revenues we receive on our\nETPs backed by gold are paid in gold ounces. In addition, we pay gold ounces to satisfy our deferred consideration obligation (See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). While we may readily sell the gold that we earn under these advisory contracts, we still may maintain a position. We currently do not enter into arrangements to hedge against fluctuations in the price of gold and any hedging we may undertake in the future may not be cost-effective or sufficient to hedge against this gold exposure.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "This text provides an overview of the market risks associated with WisdomTree's Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). These risks include fluctuations in securities or commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, and interest rates. These fluctuations can reduce the value of investment securities and, in turn, the underlying assets on which WisdomTree's revenues are earned. Additionally, WisdomTree is exposed to foreign currency translation risk and commodity price risk, particularly with regards to gold. WisdomTree does not currently enter into derivative financial instruments to offset these risks, but may do so in the future."}

The complaints allege that between February 7, 2000 and August 23, 2000, the defendants made false and misleading statements which had the effect of inflating the market price of our stock, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this action. A negative outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Failure to prevail in the litigation could result in, among other things, the payment of substantial monetary or punitive damages.\nIn October 1997, a lawsuit was filed by System Management ARTS against Avesta and one of its employees alleging infringement of two patents, unfair competition, breach of contract and interference with contractual relations resulting in unjust enrichment. Avesta answered the complaint, denying all allegations, and also asserted counterclaims against the plaintiff for patent misuse, unfair competition and interference with business and patent invalidity. The plaintiff has since dropped one of the patents from the lawsuit and certain of Avesta\u2019s counterclaims have been dismissed. Avesta\u2019s counterclaims currently seek a declaratory\njudgment (i) that its products do not infringe the plaintiff\u2019s patents; (ii) that the remaining patent is invalid; and (iii) that the remaining patent is unenforceable. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter and we believe that the plaintiff\u2019s claims are entirely without merit. We cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this action. Both parties have filed motions for partial summary judgment that have been denied. A negative outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Failure to prevail in the litigation could result in one or more of the following: (i) the payment of substantial monetary and punitive damages; (ii) the reimbursement of the plaintiff\u2019s legal costs; (iii) the requirement to stop selling one of our major products in its current form; (iv) the redesign of that product; (v) the requirement to license certain technology from the plaintiff, which could include significant royalty payments; and (vi) the indemnification of certain customers against the losses they may incur due to the alleged infringement.

We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation, investing or trading.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our net sales, expenses and capital purchases are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we have exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred. As of December 31, 2019, the impact to our income from operations of a 10% change (up or down) in exchange rates is estimated to be an increase or decrease of approximately $30 million on an annual basis.\nWe use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of $523 million maturing at various dates through September 1, 2024.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe centrally manage our debt portfolio through the use of interest rate swaps and monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our fixed-rate debt, excluding capital lease obligations, was $11,802 million and our variable-rate debt was $2,618 million, inclusive of commercial paper.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2019, the total notional value of receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps was $50 million and the total notional value of receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps was $575 million.\nThe following table is an estimate of the impact to our interest expense based upon our variable rate debt and derivative instruments and the fair value of the interest rate swaps that could result from hypothetical interest rate changes during the term of the financial instruments, based on debt levels as of December 31, 2019:\n(1)\nWe pay an average floating rate, which fluctuates periodically, based on LIBOR and a credit spread, as a result of certain derivative instruments and variable rate debt instruments. See Notes 9 and 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCommodity Risks\nWe are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. Our principal commodities risks relate to our purchases of coffee beans, PET, aluminum, diesel fuel, corn (for high fructose corn syrup), apple juice concentrate, apples, sucrose and natural gas (for use in processing and packaging).\nWe utilize commodities derivative instruments and supplier pricing agreements to hedge the risk of movements in commodity prices for limited time periods for certain commodities.

Mr. Chew claims that he was one of our founders and that we and Mr. Bowles breached alleged promises to issue founder's stock to Mr. Chew in exchange for his services. Mr. Chew alleges damages of at least $10 million and seeks a determination from the Court that he is entitled to an unspecified number of shares of our capital stock. Mr. Chew's complaint is not clear whether his claims for such relief are cumulative or in the alternative. In subsequent filings with the Court, Mr. Chew has claimed entitlement to the same number of shares as received by another of our founders and board member, Robert Wilmot. We intend to defend this action vigorously, however, litigation is inherently uncertain, and we may not prevail against Mr. Chew.

Prior to its expiration, PRM formally requested an extension through a second Temporary Cessation. PRM subsequently participated in a public process which culminated in a hearing on July 26, 2017. Prior to the hearing, three non-profit organizations who pursue environmental and conservation objectives filed a brief objecting to the extension. The MLRB board members voted to grant a second five-year Temporary Cessation for the Van 4 Mine. Thereafter, the three objecting parties filed a lawsuit on September 18, 2017. The MLRB was named as the defendant and PRM was named as a party to the case due to the Colorado law requirement that any lawsuit filed after a hearing must include all of the parties in the proceeding. The plaintiff organizations are seeking for the court to set aside the board order granting a second five-year Temporary Cessation period to PRM for the Van 4 Mine. The Colorado state Attorney General was defending this action in the Denver Colorado District Court. On May 8, 2018, the Denver Colorado District Court ruled in favor, whereby the additional five-year temporary cessation period was granted. The Plaintiffs appealed this ruling to the Colorado Court of Appeals and on July 25, 2019 the ruling was reversed, whereby the additional five-year temporary cessation period should not have been granted. The Judge has subsequently issued an instruction for the MLRB to issue an order revoking the permit and putting the Van 4 Mine into reclamation. On March 2, 2020, the MLRB issued an order vacating the Van 4 Temporary Cessation, terminating mining operations and ordering commencement of final reclamation. The Company has begun preparations for the reclamation of the Van 4 Mine. The reclamation cost is fully covered by the reclamation bonds posted upon acquisition of the property.\nOn February 4, 2020, the Colorado DRMS sent a Notice of Hearing to Declare Termination of Mining Operations to Western for the Sunday Mine Complex. At issue is the application of an unchallenged Colorado Court of Appeals Opinion for a separate mine, with very different facts that is retroactively modifying DRMS rules and regulations. The Company maintains that it was timely in meeting existing rules and regulations. The formal hearing was scheduled to be held during the April 22-23, 2020 MLRB Board meeting, which has now been moved to the May 13-14, 2020 MLRB Board meeting due to the impacts of the COVID-19 virus.\nITEM 4.", "summary": "This text discusses legal proceedings related to the Company's Van 4 Mine and Sunday Mine Complex.

{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings. We are exposed to various market risks including: (i) investment portfolio risk, (ii) interest rate risk, and (iii) foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nInvestment portfolio risk. We have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions. Although investments may be subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer, or type of investment. At December 31, 2019, our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available-for-sale, which are comprised of highly rated short-term commercial paper, corporate debt instruments and US treasury and agencies obligations.\nOur marketable available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, which are deemed temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses, would be included in interest income and other expense, net.\nInterest rate risk. Our Convertible Notes bear a coupon rate of 1.00% per annum. We do not have economic interest rate expense exposure on our Convertible Notes due to their fixed interest rate nature. However, the values of the Convertible Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of our fixed interest rate Convertible Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of the Convertible Notes are affected by our stock price. The fair value of the Convertible Notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines in value. Additionally, we carry the Convertible Notes at face value less unamortized discount and issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet, and we disclose their fair value in the financial statements. See Footnote 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the fair value disclosure.\nOur Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to the greater of LIBOR plus 1.75% - 2.75% or the Lender\u2019s Prime Rate plus 0.75% - 1.75% per year. Our use of variable rate debt exposes us to interest rate risk. A 100-basis point increase in the LIBOR or Lender\u2019s Prime Rate as of December 31, 2019 would not have a material impact on net (loss) income and cash flow.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in conducting business globally in numerous currencies, of which the most significant to our operations in 2019 was the Brazilian Real. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to the operations of our subsidiary in Brazil whose financial statements are not denominated in the U.S. dollar. Our foreign operations are not material to our operations as a whole. As such, we currently do not enter into currency forward exchange or option contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A.

However, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk due to possible changes in short term interest rates as it invests its cash or borrows on its revolving credit facility and due to the portion of its variable-rate term debt that is not fixed by interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to interest rate swaps, as described below, approximately $28.4 million, or approximately 2% of the Company\u2019s total debt outstanding, was subject to variable interest rates. Based on the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019, every 100 basis points change in interest rates will impact the Company\u2019s annual net income by approximately $0.3 million, all other factors remaining the same.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had two interest rate swaps due to mature in the first half of 2020 and three interest rate swaps that will become effective during the same period, resulting in a net decrease in the notional amount of $172.5 million, which will result in a corresponding increase in the amount of the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt that is not fixed by interest rate swaps.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt consisted of its credit facilities, including borrowings outstanding under its $425 million revolving credit facility and $820 million of term loans. Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk on a portion of its variable-rate debt. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 11 interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest payments on approximately $842.5 million of the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt outstanding with maturity dates ranging from May 2020 (representing two swaps with a total notional amount of $322.5 million) to December 2029. In addition, the Company has entered into a total of four interest rate swap agreements which, beginning January 31, 2020, May 18, 2020 and May 18, 2021, will effectively fix the interest rate on $25 million, $125 million and $75 million, respectively, of its variable-rate debt.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates.\nWe may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk. We use interest rate swap agreements, for example, to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixed-rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. We use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See the discussion under Note 8, \u201cDerivative and Hedging Activities,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for certain quantitative details related to the interest rate swaps.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOutstanding Debt\nThe following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on the fair value of our total outstanding debt. Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt. Discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages payable. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. This analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt, such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change. This analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.\nFixed Interest Rate Debt\nExcept as described below, all of our outstanding debt obligations (maturing at various times through May 2029) have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates. However, interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2019, we had $1.112 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding with an estimated fair value of $1.142 billion. If interest rates at December 31, 2019 had been 1.0% higher, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately $3.4 million. If interest rates at December 31, 2019 had been 1.0% lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately $26.0 million.\nVariable Interest Rate Debt\nGenerally, we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2019, we had $250.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding. We have entered into term loans that have interest rates that contain both fixed and variable components. See the discussion under Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details related to the interest rate swaps and for a discussion on how we value derivative financial instruments. Based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms, if market interest rates increased 1.0%, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately nil with a corresponding decrease in our net income and cash flows for the year. Conversely, if market rates decreased 1.0%, our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately nil with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year.\nITEM 8.", "summary": "ITEM 7A discusses the market risk associated with the company's financial instruments. It explains that the company may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk, and that it uses derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation.

For the variable rate debt, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would have no effect on the company's annual interest expense, while a 1.0% decrease in interest rates would also have no effect."}

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nEOTT enters into forwards, futures and other contracts primarily for the purpose of hedging the impact of market fluctuations on assets, liabilities or other contractual commitments. The use of financial instruments may expose EOTT to market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The major market risks are discussed below.\nCommodity Price Risk. Commodity price risk is a consequence of gathering crude oil at the lease and marketing the crude oil to refineries or other trade partners. EOTT uses forwards, futures, swaps and options to mitigate price exposure and manages this risk on a portfolio basis.\nInterest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the result of having variable rate debt obligations, as changing interest rates impact the discounted value of future cash flows and fixed rate debt obligations which impact the change in fair value.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the result of EOTT's Canadian operations. The primary purpose of EOTT's foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency purchase and sale transactions.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nEOTT has performed a value at risk analysis of virtually all of its financial assets and liabilities. Value at risk incorporates numerous variables that could impact the fair value of EOTT's investments, including commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, as well as correlation within and across these variables. EOTT estimates value at risk commodity and foreign exchange exposures using a model based on Monte Carlo simulation of delta/gamma positions, which captures a significant portion of the exposure related to open futures contracts. The value at risk method utilizes a one-day holding period and a 95% confidence level. Cross-commodity correlations are used as appropriate. The use of the value at risk model allows management to aggregate risks across the Partnership, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk.\nThe following table illustrates the value at risk for commodity price risk (in millions):\n(1) The above value at risk amount represents financial derivative commodity instruments, primarily commodity futures contracts, entered into to hedge future physical crude oil purchase commitments. The commitments to purchase physical crude oil have not been included in the above value at risk computation.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nThe Partnership's exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short-term and long-term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates. The Enron facility has a maturity of December 2001. At December 31, 2000, no amounts were outstanding under the Enron facility. In October 1999, EOTT issued $235 million of 11% senior notes due in 2009.

During 2000, the high, low, and average interest rates applicable against the loan were 24.53%, 23.70%, and 24.17%, respectively. The terms of the loan are more fully described under \"Item 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Shell Capital Loan.\" An increase of applicable interest rates will result in a corresponding increase in the interest costs associated with the loan. Furthermore, the majority of the loan interest is capitalized on a quarterly basis until we reach project completion, which exposes us to additional interest rate risk on the additional principal amount of the loan.\nWe must begin repaying the loan on December 31, 2001. The loan stipulates the minimum principal repayments required, but also requires all excess cash flows available from crude oil sales be utilized to repay the loan as quickly as possible. Earlier repayment of the loan results in significantly less interest expense charged on the loan. KKM's ability to generate excess cash flows is dependent upon many factors, including production rates, access to export markets to sell our crude oil production, and the available commodity price of crude oil. Lower crude oil prices will could significantly reduce cash flows earned by KKM, which would otherwise be used to prepay the loan. We estimate approximately $36.0 million to $45.0 million of net cash flows from oil sales will be required to repay the loan depending upon excess cash flows available to repay principal earlier than scheduled.\nTo hedge the risk of a drop in commodity prices, we entered the hedge agreement as part of the loan, paying $4.0 million for put contracts to sell a total of 1,562,250 barrels of North Sea Brent crude. The exercise prices of the various put contracts ranges from $22.35 to $17.25 per barrel, with monthly expiration dates beginning in October 2000 and ending in December 2002.

KKM must begin repaying the loan on December 31, 2001, and estimates that $36.0 million to $45.0 million of net cash flows from oil sales will be required to repay the loan. To hedge the risk of a drop in commodity prices, KKM entered a hedge agreement as part of the loan, paying $4.0 million for put contracts to sell a total of 1,562,250 barrels of North Sea Brent crude. As of December 31, 2000, the put contracts had a fair market value of $999,000."}
{"section": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled $3,749.2 million. We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $2,265.1 million. We do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $1,484.1 million balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019. A 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $7.4 million. However, some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on\ndeposits and investments also increase. We entered into interest rate swaps to hedge some of the risk of variability in cash flows resulting from future interest payments on our variable interest rate debt.\nTo ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions, we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures, from an accounting and economic perspective. However, given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged, we cannot provide any assurances that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.\nWe are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the U.S. Dollar as a normal part of the reporting process. Some of our Japanese operations utilize Japanese Yen as the functional currency, which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nWe enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $183.3 million and $157.3 million, respectively. Our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments, trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. Dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies, including Japanese Yen, Euros, Korean Won, Malaysian Ringgit, Philippine Peso, Singapore Dollars, Swiss Francs, Chinese Renminbi, and Czech Koruna. Due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies, our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the U.S. Dollar. For example, we determined that based on a hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates, our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, assuming no offsetting hedge position or correlated activities.\nSee Note 15: ''Financial Instruments'' in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further information with respect to our hedging activity.\nItem 8.", "summary": "A of the 2019 Form 10-K discloses the market risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that the company is exposed to. To mitigate these risks, the company utilizes derivative financial instruments and has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge some of the risk of variability in cash flows resulting from future interest payments on its variable interest rate debt. The company also enters into forward foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. A hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates would have impacted the company's income before taxes by approximately $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019."}
